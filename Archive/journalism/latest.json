Projections in federal budgets since the beginning of the pandemic have reflected the huge drop and subsequent increase due to closed borders, but have the rate returning to a long run average again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/11/north-sydney-mayor-nsw-premier-chris-minns-planning-laws\">North Sydney mayor says Minns government overriding planning protections like a \u2018totalitarian\u2019 regime</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite all of this volatility, the 2023-24 federal budget projected that the population in 2030 will only be slightly below what was estimated before the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Complicating the picture further, the government\u2019s new migration strategy, released this week, updates those figures again, based on its new changes to student and skilled worker visas. Those figures estimate that net overseas migration will fall from 510,000 in 2022-23 to 235,000 in 2026-27.

But the effects on issues such as housing, labour markets and inflation, especially in the short term, are not clear, according to Dr Ryan Edwards, an economist at ANU.</p> \n<p>Edwards says migration works on supply and demand \u2013 immigrants consume goods and services but they also fill job shortages and bring necessary skills. Over the long run, they help increase productivity and all of this is on top of the benefits to migrants themselves.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s potentially negative and potentially positive effects across a whole range of markets\u201d says Edwards.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd especially when it comes to housing and inflation, we don\u2019t really have that much conclusive evidence either way. It\u2019s quite decidedly mixed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many Australian industries rely heavily on temporary migrants, especially hospitality, healthcare, childcare and construction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/11/oz-immigration-explainer/jobs_visas\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe Australian economy has had a need for additional workers,\u201d says Prof Robert Breunig from ANU, who has done <a href=\"https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/assets/documents/hilda-bibliography/working-discussion-research-papers/2015/migrant-intake-draft-supplementc-1.pdf\">research</a> on the effect of migration on Australian workers.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd immigrants who come here actually spend a lot of money. They create a big demand for goods and services in Australia. And so it turns out, at least over the last 20 years, those two things kind of balance out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Breunig says the caring sectors are particularly dependent on migrants. \u201cIf we close the country off to migrants, wages will go up. But we\u2019ll also have a lot of labour shortages and a lot of services won\u2019t get delivered.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the conversation is a little more complicated than \u2018migrants drive up housing prices\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>The housing market hasn\u2019t kept up with the surge in migration over the past 12 to 18 months, but it has kept pace over the previous decade, according to Dr Ben Phillips from ANU\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had very strong immigration since the late 2000s,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cAnd by and large since then, we have really built a lot of housing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-231207-immigration-dblog-total-dwelling-population-indexed-line&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"New dwelling construction has outstripped population growth over the past decade\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?key=oz-231207-immigration-dblog-total-dwelling-population-indexed-line&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPlenty would argue that if we built more [houses] that prices would be a little bit lower, rents might be a little bit lower.

We do not agree with this plan.\u201d</p> <p>Queensland is particularly concerned about the commonwealth\u2019s approach on transport corridors, which they said would cap spending on the state\u2019s most important road, the Bruce Highway.</p> <p>The anger was also fuelled by an earlier announcement that the commonwealth is moving away from paying 80% for regional road projects, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/14/state-labor-leaders-clash-federal-government-infrastructure-plan\">will mostly split the cost evenly with states</a>.</p> <p>The deputy premier, Steven Miles, will lead a delegation of mayors to Canberra.

Due to the rising cost of materials like concrete and bitumen, the price of projects is expected to increase \u2013 which would have to be paid for by the state, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo the federal government is forcing decisions on project cuts on to Queensland and that is not fair,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The largest project to lose funding is the Mooloolah River interchange upgrade on the Sunshine Coast. The government had previously committed funding of $160m, about 50% of the total cost of the project.</p> <p>State government estimates put the cost to the Queensland budget at around $14bn over 10 years, with $6bn less for the Bruce Highway alone.</p> <h2>New South Wales</h2> <p><strong>Value of projects now unfunded by the federal government: $5.4bn</strong></p> <p>The NSW government expressed \u201cdisappointment with a capital D\u201d over the cut in federal funding for a number of major projects, including a key interchange between the M7 and M12 motorways in Western Sydney.</p> <p>The treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, accused King of going back on her word after she had promised not to \u201cyank\u201d funding out of any project already being delivered.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time NSW\u2019s population is surging the commonwealth investment is faltering,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s even worse is that some of the projects for which the commonwealth has yanked funding are already in delivery.\u201d</p> <p>He says early analysis shows 18 projects may not go ahead because of the cuts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that NSW \u2026 has been talking to the commonwealth but they haven\u2019t been listening,\u201d Mookhey says.</p> <p>\u201cEvery dollar taken from NSW has to come back to NSW.\u201d</p> <p>Other axed projects include commuter car park upgrades at train stations in Kingswood, St Marys and Woy Woy \u2013 which were criticised by Labor as pork barrelling when first announced by the Morrison government.</p> <p>A billion-dollar upgrade of the Great Western Highway through the Blue Mountains is among the biggest projects to lose commonwealth funding.</p> <p>The infrastructure review also spells the end of plans to hasten the speed of trains between Newcastle and Sydney, with a plan to quadruple a 10km stretch of track between Tuggerah and Wyong now without funding.</p> <p>Support for upgrades of several regional roads was also axed, including for the Bruxner Highway in northern NSW, and for planning works relating to the Gwydir and Oxley highways.</p> <h2>Victoria</h2> <p><strong>Value of projects now unfunded by the federal government: $4.8bn </strong></p> <p>In Victoria, the most significant news to come out of the review was the decision to approve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/10/melbourne-airport-rail-line-tullamarine\">the long-awaited Melbourne Airport train line</a>.</p> <p>In 2020, the state and federal government each committed $5bn to the project.

Pollsters try to match their sample against Australia\u2019s voting population on multiple demographic factors, such as age, sex, income and location. After the 2019 polling failure, many pollsters also try to match on education levels.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>\u201cYou can get, on average, quite close to the properties of a whole population by taking a sample of 1,000 or so,\u201d says election analyst Dr Kevin Bonham. \u201cPeople can do this experiment for themselves if they like by tossing coins and keeping track of the cumulative total and noticing how the [percentages of heads] converges on 50%.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll else being equal, and assuming that there is a perfect sample, 1,000 respondents is most of the time going to give you the right answer within a few percent.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Are landline phones a problem?</h2> \n<p>In the past, pollsters used to contact people via telephone. But all the public polls for the voice have been conducted entirely online. Polling companies have large \u201cpanels\u201d with tens or hundreds of thousands of members who signed up themselves as part of loyalty programs or were invited.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much, much easier with online panel polling to know enough about your respondent to know who you want to invite for a given survey,\u201d says Bonham. \u201cIn the old days of random phone polling, you\u2019d be ringing and saying things like: \u2018Can I speak to the youngest person in the house or the person who had the last birthday?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0f4318b7-0a29-4c7a-a39c-cb83f3f4e2d3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9og2_hKz4vA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Armed with demographic information, pollsters will send out emails containing survey questions over a few days.

There were 9,000 more people living in Zetland in metro Sydney in 2021 than there were in 2011.</p> <p>Hunters Hill, on the other side of the harbour, has an almost identical population in the 2021 census as in 2011 (it was slightly higher in 2016, pre-pandemic). But only about 300 more dwellings were added over the 10 years.</p> <p>Density in many suburbs along the Sydney harbour including Elizabeth Bay, Rushcutters Bay and Millers Point went backwards over the 10 years. The same happened in Carlton North and Flemington in Melbourne\u2019s north and north-west.</p> <p> Pafka says a lot of the differences in density across cities and time can be partly explained by changing household composition and changed housing.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have less children now. So that\u2019s one reason for changed densities in areas like Elizabeth Bay.

So the national park in the south, Blue Mountains in the west, Ku-ring-gai in the north.</p> <p>\u201cSo basically, [Sydney] doesn\u2019t sprawl that much, as compared to Melbourne that, through planning systems, had green belts that were constantly shifting.\u201d</p> <p>But even though Sydney has the greatest density in Australia, it is far from the most dense internationally.

A huge number of factors can influence this, according to Dr Linden Ashcroft, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne.</p> \n<p>Ashcroft notes that both macro geographies (such as how close you are to the equator) and micro geographies (such as mountain ranges, deserts and urban areas) have a huge impact on the weather. Among other things these affect the direction and source of breezes, whether air can flow or is trapped, whether there is thermal mass to even out temperature fluctuations.</p> \n<p>\u201cParramatta [in Sydney], is quite often the hottest place in the world in the summertime because of the Blue Mountains \u2026 and also the fact that Sydney stretches so far west and the sea breeze doesn\u2019t extend that far inland,\u201d Ashcroft says. <br><br>\u201dYou also see that in Melbourne, where the sea breeze will intrude in the CBD and it might get up into some of the northern suburbs, but not the airport.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brisbane and south-east Queensland often experience severe storms because of the interaction between weather coming in from the ocean and from the mountain range.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this interaction between moist air sources coming off the ocean and dry air sources coming from inland and you get this trough \u2013 it\u2019s like a little dip in the air pressure and depending on where that sits, you can get some really explosive thunderstorms\u201d, Ashcroft says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/superyacht/1/index.html?key=oz-bom-weather-anomaly-total-hot-cold-and-rainy&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"Number of days when it was hot, cold and rainy by city\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/superyacht/1/index.html?key=oz-bom-weather-anomaly-total-hot-cold-and-rainy&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>We set out to test whether Melbourne really does have \u201cfour seasons in one day\u201d \u2013 days that are at some point hot, cold, rainy and stormy. But it turns out that Darwin, Adelaide and Canberra have the most days that fit this criteria \u2013 more than 500 days in the past two decades. Melbourne is quite far down the list.</p> \n<p>But the huge variation in and across Australia\u2019s capital cities means this was always likely. Darwin has more days with greater than 5mm of rain and so is more likely to fullill all these criteria. And Canberra has the largest average range in temperatures across the day throughout the year.</p> \n<p>Melbourne gets a lot of its rainier days in winter, but that\u2019s also the time of year when its temperature range reduces significantly.

Unemployed, Hanke made his own oil paint, got a scrap of canvas, and painted himself because he couldn\u2019t afford a model, ripped a frame off another work, and won.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was criticised at the time because he wasn\u2019t a well-known painter,\u201d Wilson says.</p> \n<p>The colours used in Archibald portraits have changed significantly over time. Earlier portraits were dominated by blacks, browns and other dark values \u2013 up to 70% of the portrait surface in the first couple of decades.</p> \n<p>This may be because, as Mendelssohn notes, many of the earlier portraits were painted in the style of 19th-century European art. \u201cSo a serious portrait had to have a brown background,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t until 1966 that John Molvig\u2019s portrait of fellow artist Charlie Blackman \u201csuddenly introduced that pop of colour,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThen we got a procession of works through the 1970s with very vivid colour that is non-naturalistic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/04/archibald-datablog-colour-stream-chart/colour_bars\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many recent paintings have continued this trend. When Cherry Hood won the 2002 prize with a watercolour painting of pianist Simon Tedeschi, it was almost entirely light skin tones over a white background.</p> \n<p>The actual size of the works has also changed with time. In the first decade, miniatures \u2013 under 10cm \u2013 were the flavour of the day, Wilson says.</p> \n<p>Portraits slowly increased in size until the 1970s, when American pop-art influenced many \u201cbig head\u201d entrants and hyper-real portraits.

His father was a qazi (Muslim judge), owned a shop and had one of the few cars around. My grandfather got to study in English and he always talked about the big library they had at school, where he probably discovered many of the quotes he subsequently bombarded us with.</p> <p>But by the time he finished school his father was broke: with little more than his parent\u2019s blessing, he had to find his own way.

I wrote down everything I read, did and thought. I started each book by copying out the poem on the front page. I went through so many journals it got to a point I could recite the poem even though I often couldn\u2019t tell you what I\u2019d done that day.</p> <p>It became a refuge when I was down over how much time I\u2019d lost, how much I couldn\u2019t do any more.

She has been paying off a mortgage on a unit for 20 years and has about 50% equity.</p> <p>She saved money to contribute to the cost of the car and was not borrowing the whole amount. The bank nevertheless only allowed her to take out the loan if she cancelled her credit card.</p> <p>\u201cI know I\u2019m in a really fortunate position compared to a lot of people,\u201d Tracy says. \u201cHaving said that, I do pay pretty much half my take-home pay to service my mortgage and all the costs associated with the unit complex, in an attempt to pay it all off before I retire.\u201d She has had to bring in a boarder to help manage the day-to-day costs of living.</p> <p>Part of the problem with Hecs/Help debts, Thurmond says, is how long they stick around. \u201cWith a personal loan or car loan you\u2019ll have that paid off in 5-10 years, but a Hecs debt will carry for much longer.\u201d</p> <p>The gender dynamics of the debt burden are complex. There are significantly more women than men with Help debts, however, men tend to accumulate higher debts. In 2020-21, the most recent year where data is available, more women than men in every age bracket have a debt, with twice as many female debtors as men among 40 to 49 and 50 to 59-year-olds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=oz-dblogs-help-debts-age-sex-grouped-bar&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"Debtors by age and sex\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=oz-dblogs-help-debts-age-sex-grouped-bar&location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Katherine, 42, who is a regional New South Wales resident who requested a pseudonym due to the sensitivities of her work, says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll never pay off my Hecs.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine first began studying in 1998 and completed two years of a computer-science degree before switching to a four-year psychology degree.

Housing construction during the pandemic did not keep up with demand,\u201d says Dr Thomas Sigler, an urban and economic geographer from the University of Queensland.</p> \n<p>Other reasons for growth in short-term rentals and the price of longer term rentals could include<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/jun/22/australias-borders-were-closed-and-population-growth-stalled-so-why-are-houses-so-expensive\">changing household dynamics</a>, migration away from inner cities, increased remote work, and the increasing \u201cprofessionalisation\u201d of the short-term rental industry. Some regions with significant price rises have also seen serial disasters such as floods and fires affecting the housing stock.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an increasing premium on place and space because people aren\u2019t travelling,\u201d Sigler says. \u201cSo yes we want that extra bedroom so I can have a Zoom room. There\u2019s a lot of reasons people want more space.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>A Guardian Australia analysis of Airbnb locations and rental prices for each postcode showed no overall correlation between rent increases and Airbnb density, with only a few areas overlapping with both high Airbnb density and high rental increases.</p> \n<p>Most of the areas where there is both a high share of Airbnbs and huge recent rental increases are what Sigler calls \u201csuper tourism\u201d areas \u2013 such as Byron Bay. About 30% of Byron\u2019s dwellings are listed on Airbnb \u2013 depending on how you count.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker_v6/html/index.html?key=nsw-poa-airbnb-maps\" data-alt=\"Housing in NSW by postcode\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker_v6/html/index.html?key=nsw-poa-airbnb-maps\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But if you look at postcodes surrounding Byron the numbers of short-term rentals drop significantly, even in ones that have seen bigger increases in long-term rental prices.</p> \n<p>Most tourism areas have about 5%-10% of their dwellings for short-term rentals, and it\u2019s closer to 1%-2% in metropolitan Sydney and Melbourne, which are also seeing huge increases in longer term rental prices.</p> \n<p>Port Fairy along the Great Ocean Road in Victoria also has a relatively high density of Airbnbs and large year-on-year increases in rent.

A total of 130,000 of these were holiday homes \u2013 they stopped asking this question on subsequent census.</p> \n<p>There has also been significant changes in the composition of the short-term rental market over the past few years. The number of short-term rentals boomed between 2016 and 2019 \u2013 coinciding with a glut of apartments coming on the market \u2013 peaking at more than 300,000 properties. But this has since dropped to the \u201clow 200,000s\u201d, Sigler says.</p> \n<p>Data on monthly available listings on Airbnb shows a drop from more than 150,000 listings in December 2019 to about 130,000 in recent months. But this isn\u2019t uniform across the country.

From following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/may/17/campaign-tracker-where-have-shorten-and-turnbull-been-and-what-have-they-promised\">leader announcements in 2016</a>, we knew that announcements could appear in media releases, local media, and on Facebook.</p> <p>We decided to focus on Facebook and media releases posted on personal and party websites.</p> <p>To gather the data we used the Facebook API to collate politicians\u2019 posts into a SQLite database, and wrote web-scrapers in Python for over 200 websites<strong> </strong>to get text from media releases which was then also stored in SQLite.</p> <p>The biggest challenge was then how to pull out the posts that had funding announcements in them from the rest.</p> <h2><strong>The solution (machine learning and manual labour)</strong></h2> <p>The output we wanted was to have a final database of only election spending promises, classified into categories, such as sport, community, crime, and so on. Each promise would also be assigned to either a single electorate or state or territory, depending on the location which would benefit most from the spending. This would allow the necessary analysis by seat and party status we\u2019d need for news stories.</p> <p>Our initial approach was to classify two weeks\u2019 worth of Facebook posts. This initial analysis showed some commonalities in posts and releases that contained election promises. These included references to money, mentioning specific grant programs, and some keywords. But just selecting posts that contained these features would have missed a lot and had a very high false positive rate.</p> <p>So we went with a blended approach. We used pre-trained language models to extract keywords, geographic locations, grant program names, named entities (like the Prime Minister), and any references to money. We then manually classified 300 randomly selected posts as either containing election promises or not. We lemmatised each word (turned them into their dictionary form, removing tense and pluralisation etc.), and turned each text into a series of numbers (a word embedding, or vector).</p> <p>The vectors were created using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), which assigns values based on how common a word is in a single text compared to the rest of the texts. This emphasises some of the differences between the texts, and together with the cosine similarity (based on the angles of the vectors if plotted), allowed us to group posts and releases that were likely about the same topic.</p> <p>Finally, we trained a logistic regression model using the posts we had already manually classified. A number of other machine learning techniques were tested, but logistic regression was consistently the most accurate for our binary classification task - election promise or not.</p> <p>With the classifier trained and all the extraction scripts setup, we created a pipeline where all new posts had pertinent features extracted and then a prediction was made. Any post that had a combination of features and was predicted to contain an election promise was flagged for manual review. Any media release that was dissimilar (based on cosine similarity) from the Facebook posts were similarly processed and flagged for review. We repeatedly retrained our classifier throughout the election campaign as we got more and more confirmed data.</p> <p>Once the classifier was up and running, our approach was:</p> <ol> <li><p>Scrape Facebook posts and media releases</p></li> <li><p>Run posts through our classifier and duplicate checker</p></li> <li><p>Manually check posts flagged as announcements and remove duplicates, add other categories and details needed</p></li> <li><p>Find any media releases that were dissimilar to the Facebook posts and process them</p></li> <li><p>Manually double-check all the data before publishing</p></li> </ol> <h2><strong>Things we learned</strong></h2> <p>Despite the automation, this process was still time-consuming. However, we were able to run the project in a campaign week with two days of work from two journalists and an intern working three or four days (with extra time from news and political reporters on the actual stories). Without the automation and machine-learning side of things, the same project would have required quite many more people to achieve the same result in the same time.</p> <p>This was our first attempt at such a large machine learning and natural language processing project, and there\u2019s quite a bit for us to take away and improvements that could be made.</p> <p>For starters this project was almost entirely conducted using our work laptops, and so choices were made that best utilised the computer power we had available. During testing we played with more complicated methods to create word embeddings, such as <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/algorithms/bert-start\">Google\u2019s BERT transformer</a>. This would have allowed us to preserve some more of the context within our corpus. However, these methods took so long on a laptop, that we reverted to a simpler methods of encoding. If we do a project like this again we\u2019d likely be better off offloading the computational tasks to the cloud, meaning we could employ more methods like deep learning and models like BERT.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a lot of experimenting left to do with the text preparation. We did not mess much with the words in the text during our preprocessing. Apart from lematising the words we removed only the most common English filler words. However, eliminating a more extensive list of words devoid of meaning could reduce some of the noise in our data and make it easier to identify the promises. We could also try training our model with text comprising n-grams, b-grams, or combinations that include parts of speech. All of this might provide more context for the machine learning model and improve accuracy.</p> <p>We wrote several helper scripts intended to aid our manual review, such as by turning mentions of money into real numbers ($3m to 3,000,000). However, we only scratched the surface here. For instance, we didn\u2019t delve much into language models and parts of speech to programmatically identify and remove re-announcements of election promises, which was all done manually. This might also have been achieved through its own machine learning model if we had trained one.</p> <h2><strong>Bonus round: training an object recognition model to recognise novelty cheques and hardhats</strong></h2> <p>While the methods above worked for the text of the Facebook posts, it couldn\u2019t do much for the photos posted by politicians.</p> <p>So, we found ourselves asking an important question. Could we use machine learning to spot photos of novelty cheques? Having another model in place to find big cheques and certificates in photos might pick up things we\u2019d missed in the text, and also it was quite funny.</p> <p>Giant cheques have made news in previous years \u2013 in 2019 when the former Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/24/call-for-investigation-after-georgina-downer-presents-cheque-to-bowling-club\">presented a grant to a bowling club</a> despite this practice usually being the domain of the sitting MP. A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/21/labor-wants-pauline-hanson-investigated-over-23m-rockhampton-stadium-novelty-cheque\">$23m grant for Rockhampton stadium</a>.</p> <p>With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs.</p> <p>We chose these as they were either already available in pre-trained models such as <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\">Coco</a>, or had publicly available image datasets for model training.</p> <p>For the object detection machine learning process we used the <a href=\"https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI\">ImageAI Python library</a>, which is based on TensorFlow.</p> <p>ImageAI made it easy to get going without knowing too much about the underlying tech, but if we did it again I think we\u2019d go directly to TensorFlow or PyTorch. When it came to figuring out problems with our models and model training there wasn\u2019t much documentation for ImageAI, whereas TensorFlow and PyTorch are both widely-used with large communities of users.</p> <p>Another option is an API-based approach, such as <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision\">Google\u2019s Vision AI</a>, but cost was a factor for training models, which we\u2019d need to do if we wanted to detect novelty cheques.</p> <p>For each of the categories of hi-vis workwear, hardhats and novelty cheques we trained a custom YOLOv3 object detection model. Hi-vis was based on a publicly available dataset of 800 photos, while hardhat detection was based on a publicly available dataset of 1,500 photos. Dogs, sports balls and people were detected using a RetinaNet model pre-trained on the Coco dataset.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9490ec4222e1d0672bee944c7fc92e5b4f172c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9490ec4222e1d0672bee944c7fc92e5b4f172c0/0_24_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Albanese holding a small dog on the campaign trail, annotated by Guardian Australia\u2019s dog detection model\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Albanese holding a small dog on the campaign trail, annotated by Guardian Australia\u2019s dog detection model</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For cheques, we collated and labelled 310 images of giant cheques to train the cheque-detection model. Again, if we did it again we\u2019d probably spend more time on the model training step, using larger datasets and experimenting with grayscale and other tweaks.</p> <p>This time around, we trained the models on a PC (using the Windows Linux subsystem) with a decent graphics card and processor. While we also tried using Google CoLab for this, running the models locally was incredibly helpful for iterating and tweaking different settings.</p> <p>Once we had the object detection models up and running, we collated Facebook photos for all Labor and Coalition MPs, candidates and senators for the 2019 and 2022 campaign periods, and then ran the object detection models over them.

That said, the approach was still much, much better than anything we could have achieved by doing it manually.</p> <p><em>Note: while we would normally share the code for projects we blog about, the machine learning parts of this project involves a lot of data we\u2019re not able to share publicly for various reasons.

This figure had dropped from a high of more than 30% in April 2021.</p> \n<p>Roose said the anti-Covid vaccination movement was part of the larger protests against Covid measures such as lockdowns.</p> \n<p>\u201cReally it was only ever a couple of hundred people that was showing up at these [anti-vaccination protests], in the early days. As the lockdowns took hold, people started losing their jobs, and people \u2026 were frustrated and angry and we saw an increase in the size of those protests,\u201d Roose said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe largest protests in Melbourne were made up of a lot of workers who had lost jobs or who were being told they had to be vaccinated. That was back in September. But for the most part the anti-vax movement has only ever been a really small percentage of the community.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many political parties and candidates sought to leverage this movement. UAP leader Craig Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/craig-kelly-billed-taxpayers-to-fly-to-melbourne-anti-lockdown-rallies\">joined anti-mandate protests</a>, for instance. One Nation, the Liberal Democrats, UAP, Great Australia party and the Informed Medical Options party adopted explicit policies against vaccine mandates.</p> \n<p>One Nation and UAP received a combined 9% of first preference votes. But a significant part of the swing to these parties is likely because they ran more candidates. One Nation ran 149 candidates in the 2022 election compared to just 59 in 2019. The Liberal Democrats ran in 100 seats in 2022 and just 10 in 2019.</p> \n<p>The Great Australia and Informed Medical Options parties also ran more candidates in 2022 than 2019.

When given the caption \u201ca herd of giraffes on a ship\u201d, it created a bunch of giraffe-coloured blobs standing in water.

So what\u2019s changed so that the stuff it makes doesn\u2019t resemble completely horrible nightmares any more?</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s been a number of developments in techniques, as well as the datasets that they train on. In 2020 a company named OpenAi released GPT-3 \u2013 an algorithm that is able to generate text eerily close to what a human could write. One of the most hyped text-to-image generating algorithms, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALLE</a>, is based on GPT-3; more recently, Google released <a href=\"https://imagen.research.google/\">Imagen</a>, using their own text models.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/sep/03/why-is-ted-lasso-actor-brett-goldstein-telling-everyone-hes-actually-a-human-man\">Why is Ted Lasso actor Brett Goldstein telling everyone he\u2019s actually \u2018a human man\u2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These algorithms are fed massive amounts of data and forced to do thousands of \u201cexercises\u201d to get better at prediction.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Exercises\u2019?

When you use one of these models you\u2019re probably only seeing a handful of the images that were actually generated. Similar to how these models were initially trained to predict the best captions for images, they only show you the images that best fit the text you gave them. They are marking themselves.</p> <p><strong>But there\u2019s still weaknesses in this generation process, right?</strong></p> <p>I can\u2019t stress enough that this isn\u2019t intelligence. The algorithms don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d what the words mean or the images in the same way you or I do. It\u2019s kind of like a best guess based on what it\u2019s \u201cseen\u201d before.

But computing power is also getting cheaper, there are many huge image datasets, and even regular people are <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image&amp;sort=downloads\">creating their own models</a>.

A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/21/labor-wants-pauline-hanson-investigated-over-23m-rockhampton-stadium-novelty-cheque\">$23m grant for Rockhampton stadium</a>.</p> <p>With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs.</p> <p>We chose these as they were either already available in pre-trained models such as <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\">Coco</a>, or had publicly available image datasets for model training.</p> <p>Then we collated every photo posted by a major party candidate, MP or senator to Facebook in the 2022 and 2019 election periods using the Facebook API, and ran our object detection models on these images.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"203d276062afd0ef020483e630aa124c1727e7ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203d276062afd0ef020483e630aa124c1727e7ec/0_125_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Albanese speaking to the media at a Toll warehouse\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Safety first: Anthony Albanese speaks to the media at a Toll warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what did we find?</p> <p>First, some important caveats about our method.</p> <p>While many of the images do constitute pictures from photo ops, many photos are also just things politicians shared on their pages. For the prime ministerial candidates, the Facebook photo dataset also doesn\u2019t include every photo op they\u2019ve done on the campaign trail \u2013 we were able to cross-check this <a href=\"https://photos.aap.com.au/galleries/Newsroom/ELECTION22\">thanks to AAP\u2019s comprehensive election coverage</a>.</p> <p>So the dataset is not necessarily all the photos the politicians want to go on the news, but definitely the ones they want to share with voters on social media.</p> <p>We also first checked each image for the presence of a person before running the object detection. This excludes photos that only had a dog, for example. Our method also can\u2019t tell if the politician is the one wearing the hi-vis, so if a politician shares a photo of someone else in workwear, it will be counted.</p> <p>These detection methods also don\u2019t have 100% accuracy, so it\u2019s best to treat the following numbers as a minimum count.</p> <p>Here is the total number of all photos featuring each thing, along with the proportion of all photos in that campaign year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/05/ai2html-output_photo-ops\" data-alt=\"photo ops summary\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/05/ai2html-output_photo-ops\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It suggests that politicians are leaning even more heavily into the hi-vis photo opportunity, and leveraging the broad appeal of the cute dog. Novelty cheques however are relatively scarce in this campaign period, and footballs and other sports balls are down on 2019.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s look only at the photos posted by the leaders of the major parties \u2013 the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese.

That is about three Sydney Harbours\u2019 worth of water.</p> \n<p>Compared with the floods of 2011, Khan says this is about 50% more water into the dam in about half of the time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/02/nsw-cumulative-rainfall/katoomba\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWivenhoe has never dealt with that volume of water but it was lucky it was down at 60% at the start. If we had started where we started from in 2011 we would be in serious trouble.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the rain falls, the Brisbane River hits moderate flood levels. There is already local flooding from the intense and incessant rain that is interspersed with violent thunderstorms.</p> \n<h2>Sunday, 27 February</h2> \n<p>Brisbane wakes up to major flooding. The Queensland capital\u2019s mayor, Adrian Schrinner, says there is a \u201crain bomb\u201d over the city. Prime inner-city areas including much of the South Bank precinct are underwater.</p> \n<p>There are scenes of devastation in low-lying suburbs, along creeks, and in the river itself where pontoons break free and ferry terminals are littered with smashed boats and debris.</p> \n<p>A high tide on Sunday evening pushes the river higher as the rising ocean water effectively holds back the freshwater.</p> \n<p>The river peaks overnight at the major flood level of 3.5m, falls slightly after the high tide, and goes higher to eventually peak on Monday at 3.85m \u2013 below the 2011 peak of 4.46m.</p> \n<h2>Monday, 28 February</h2> \n<p>\u201cNobody has ever seen this amount of rain in such a short period of time over our south-east catchment,\u201d says the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk.</p> \n<p>There are up to 15,000 homes flooded in the city, with 1,544 people in evacuation centres in the south-east. Trains are cancelled, bus services limited, the main Bruce Highway is closed at multiple locations and 51,000 people are without power. At least 3,600 homes are flooded in Gympie.</p> \n<p>But Khan says the Brisbane flooding could easily have been much worse.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/eastern-australian-states-hit-by-major-flooding-after-rain-bomb-weather-event\">Eastern Australian states hit by major flooding after \u2018rain bomb\u2019 weather event</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere was a high degree of luck in terms of where we started from [with Wivenhoe Dam],\u201d he says, adding that the climate crisis will only raise the risk of future events.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis shows us the risk is real \u2013 to have two serious flood events in just 11 years is a pretty high frequency for a major city like Brisbane to have to deal with.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brisbane has two features that make it susceptible to flooding. A subtropical climate naturally suited to big rain events and a city and suburbs built beside rivers and creeks in front of mountain ranges.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe build our cities on rivers for a reason \u2013 it was good for transport and waste disposal \u2013 but that also means we built on flood plains,\u201d Khan says.</p> \n<p>As well as the rising river levels, the amount of rain falling locally causes flash floods all across the city and its outer suburbs as creeks swell, inundating areas that escaped the 2011 floods.</p> \n<p>According to Domensino, some 611.6mm of rain fell on the city between 9am Friday and 6pm Sunday \u2013 the highest three-day total in records dating back to 1840. The previous record was 600.4mm in 1974.</p> \n<p>Domensino says while several features in the atmosphere combined to deliver the rain, climate change likely made the event worse.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven climate change is a background to all weather events, it\u2019s hard to say that it does not play a role,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know the oceans are getting warmer and that puts more moisture in the atmosphere, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BoM has said heavy rainfall events will get more intense as the world gets hotter.</p> \n<p>Prof Bofu Yu, of Griffith University\u2019s Australian Rivers Institute, says in 2011 rainfall was concentrated in the west and not as widespread as the current flooding.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a result, flooding this time has been much more extensive from small creeks and large rivers,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>As Brisbane starts a long and costly clean-up, hundreds of cars are stuck on the main M1 highway to the south.</p> \n<p>There is devastation in northern NSW as Wilsons River rises two metres above previous flood records, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/lismore-flood-worst-history-nsw-floods-2022-rescued-evacuated\">inundating the town of Lismore</a>.

[And] I have the original Pokemon Red on my smartphone.\u201d</p> <p>Bowman, an associate professor of journalism and creative media industries at Texas Tech University, has a vast collection of consoles and hundreds of cartridges and discs.</p> <p>Like me, he grew up in a time when video games were intimately tied to a physical device. We played using handheld consoles, while the games themselves were on cartridges \u2013 the kind you pulled out and blew out the dust from if it wasn\u2019t working.</p> <p>As kids we spent hours immersed in gaming worlds, but when our devices were lost, broken or superseded, the game likely was too. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s almost like a digital smoke break. Return to this past life, play through it, and reconnect with yourself</p> <footer> <cite>Nick Bowman, Texas Tech</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While music and literature has long been well-preserved, and constantly re-released, games weren\u2019t like this. For years our favourite games were inaccessible because they were non-interoperable: the cartridges didn\u2019t work on other devices, and old computer games wouldn\u2019t run on newer operating systems.</p> <p>Playing them was only possible thanks to a handful of dedicated individuals, often anonymous, who remade or ported them to work on current systems. </p> <p>\u201cThink about all the cultural capital that was tied up in cartridges and power cables that our parents threw away,\u201d says Bowman. \u201cAnd then a couple of people found it and put it back together.\u201d</p> <h2>Reconnecting with your past self</h2> <p>Bowman\u2019s research shows how powerful the nostalgia from playing old video games can be. For many people, games are intimately tied to social networks. We played Mario tennis with our friends, or racing games with our dads.</p> <p>\u201cWe already know that games are a source of psychological wellbeing,\u201d says Bowman. \u201c\u2026With nostalgia you get sort of a bonus relatedness because you get to connect to yourself. You\u2019re replaying a game from a positive childhood memory. Those things can be particularly powerful for short-term stress release.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a digital smoke break. Return to this past life, play through it, and reconnect with yourself, literally.</p> <p>\u201cIn our research we found that people who have social nostalgia memories \u2013 memories of playing games with friends in the past \u2013 they feel connected to themselves and their friends in the past, and they also feel connected in the present.\u201d</p> <p>Nowadays, companies are going after the market for nostalgic gaming. Nintendo is slowly adding Nintendo 64 games, some of which I played as a kid, to its Switch console.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the industry was all that interested in providing nostalgic games until the retrogramers and the modders and the emulators took it upon themselves,\u201d says Bowman.</p> <p>\u201cCoders and hackers and modders, I think, saved classic gaming. They showed industry that there is a market.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12ac365003a6dd5a5b0423c428197c82237d7435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12ac365003a6dd5a5b0423c428197c82237d7435/0_0_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pok\u00e9mon Go logo on a smartphone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pok\u00e9mon Go logo on a smartphone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I had the tools and skills\u2019</h2> <p>The Raspberry Pi Bowman has on his desk is a basic computer loaded with emulators. Emulators are software that can behave like the hardware of a video game console, allowing you to simulate a console on your computer.</p> <p>The coders and hackers that created the emulators are driven by many factors. One of the most famous emulator projects is <a href=\"https://www.mamedev.org/\">MAME</a>, which was first released almost twenty five years ago and has had <a href=\"https://github.com/mamedev/mame/graphs/contributors\">hundreds</a> of contributors.</p> <p>\u201cThat one probably has one of the most noble goals of emulators,\u201d says Stuart Cairne, a Tasmanian software developer.</p> <p>\u201cIt was trying to emulate the original hardware and preserve it so that we don\u2019t lose that part of our history. Some of the games that it emulates are from the mid and late seventies, or even earlier than that \u2013 hardware that was only available in universities.\u201d</p> <p>But other emulators are created simply for the joy of playing them, or because of the technical challenge of making them work. Many developers still have access to the old devices, and even go to the extent of opening and inspecting the chips so they can replicate bugs and make accurate digital recreations.</p> <p>Carnie, whose day job is at a data company, often found himself contributing to these projects so favourite games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)\">Monkey Island</a> would work on the operating system he used.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to play the games, and being a developer I had the tools and skills ... I would often bring them to whatever platform I was on, which has been a Mac for the past 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun just to see these things come back. It\u2019s all that nostalgia too \u2013 there\u2019s that game I used to play when I was 10 or 13, and now it\u2019s working on my PC.\u201d</p> <p>After the launch of the iOS App Store in the late 2000s, Carnie started working on a <a href=\"https://github.com/stuartcarnie/c64iphone\">Commodore 64 emulator</a> for iPhones and iPads. He and his partner in the project joined up with a big Danish game developer with industry connections so they could license everything.</p> <p>\u201cWe had licensed the branding, so we were able to sell it as a Commodore64,\u201d Carnie says. The emulator sold on the app store for US$4.99 and included five games: Dragons Den, Le Mans, Jupiter Lander, Arctic Shipwreck, and Jack Attack.</p> <p>Sometimes it was impossible to find who owned the rights to games \u2013 over the decades many of the companies went bust, or their catalogues were sold.</p> <p>\u201cWe had some big names on the emulator that we had fully licensed from people who had still retained their IP \u2026 but we also found that some of the developers we were able to communicate with no longer had the rights to it or did not know where [the rights] had gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe had one [game] we had released on the Commodore 64 for free because we couldn\u2019t track down the rights to it, and then the Bruce Lee foundation messaged us to say it had to be taken down because Bruce Lee\u2019s name cannot be used,\u201d Carnie says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/oct/02/15-video-games\">\u2018My housemates and I are addicted\u2019: 15 video games perfect for lockdown brain</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018I remember that joy\u2019</h2> <p>For many years emulators were the link to our childhoods. They existed, as Bowman and Carnie note, in somewhat of a legal grey area. Some of the most popular \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisualBoyAdvance\">Visual Boy Advance</a>, a classic Gameboy game \u2013 were created by anonymous individuals, who sometimes faced lawsuits against them.</p> <p>Mostly emulators were technically difficult to use. The amateur-created software could be hard to find and install, and buggy. The grey market for the games was full of shady websites.</p> <p>\u201cIt was hard,\u201d says Bowman. \u201c[Just to play them] you had to learn a lot of coding on the fly. I remember downloading those files and you had to trust the link, and unzip it and load it to this file and not that file. And it was always kind of a wink, wink culture.</p> <p>\u201cI remember that joy, I think it was [<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra\">the game Contra</a>], [of] hearing the sound. You go into the emulator and you have to do all the settings and I finally got it to play and all of a sudden ... I remember getting tingles that I was about to play a game, on my work computer, that I hadn\u2019t seen since I was in my jammies.\u201d</p> <p>Even if you still physically possess an old game disc, it can be a nightmare to play.</p> <p>My friend Praveen owns a disc of an old Star Wars shooting game originally created for MS Dos. Actually playing it started with trying to find a copy of Microsoft Windows 95.</p> <p>\u201cAfter that it\u2019s pretty straightforward,\u201d he says. But as he continues, it really doesn\u2019t sound like it.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to use the command line to install it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other cool thing about this game is that it\u2019s one of the early games with sound. But if you want to hear the audio you have to manually configure your sound card.\u201d</p> <p>Pretty straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cHardware comparability is a huge issue with these old games,\u201d Praveen says. \u201cThey can\u2019t \u2018comprehend\u2019 things like 1GB of RAM when they were designed to run on 16MB.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of competence and pride that comes with grabbing a controller. Turning on a 30-year-old game and entering in the same code you did when you were 11, and it works,\u201d says Bowman.</p> <p>\u201cFor a lot of older gamers we pride ourselves on not going to the guide but remembering it from when we were kids.\u201d</p> <p>Retro gaming is now more democratised than ever. Emulators have become much easier over the years \u2013 even available on smartphones. I have encountered numerous people who dipped into their childhood games to get through Covid lockdowns and other stressors.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2PBIFunhha4\">recent YouTube video</a> by someone who remade Simpsons Hit &amp; Run has had more than five million views. It\u2019s a game I also played for countless hours as a kid. Except I didn\u2019t actually own it, so all those hours were actually at my cousin\u2019s house.

Close to 70% of older Australians regularly get the flu vaccine, she said. And adults with chronic health conditions also get a flu jab in large numbers.

But even though its vaccination drive began before many others, it has vaccinated less than 55% of its population.</p> \n<p>Researchers Andrea Carson, Leah Ruppanner and Shaun Ratcliff found that when surveyed, 18% of Americans said they would not get vaccinated, and 10% were unsure about getting vaccinated.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most common reason our US respondents gave us for vaccine hesitancy was concern about side effects \u2013 66% said this. Half said it was because they did not trust the government, 43% selected lack of trust in the mainstream media, and 33% said they did not believe the vaccines worked,\u201d Ratcliff said.</p> \n<p>\u201cNearly as many said they did not believe Covid-19 posed a serious risk to themselves, and almost a quarter that they lacked trust in doctors.\u201d</p> \n<p>The data adds up to more than 100% because respondents were able to select more than one option.</p> \n<p>Most countries in our dataset took half the time Australia did to reach 5% of their populations fully vaccinated. But, like Australia, the next 5% was much quicker, and most countries seem to have hit their peak when around 20-30% of their populations were vaccinated.</p> \n<p>This is where Australia finds itself right now. From there, Canada has largely sustained the pace at less than 10 days for each additional 5% of its population fully vaccinated. Chile, Hungary and Spain have all seen rates slow slightly.</p> \n<p>The United Kingdom began to slow after hitting its peak in the 20-25% range. The United Kingdom took almost twice as long to go from 45-50% and 50-55% as it managed in its peak.</p> \n<p>After taking longer than even Australia to vaccinate the first 5% of its population, Canada has been taking on average six days to vaccinate another 5% of its population.

The Delta variant is particularly transmissible and I think with the change of tone from the premier, along with the startling numbers being reported, caution will be present for some time, even after lockdown ends.</p> <p>\u201cThe nexus will be the availability of vaccination and, for many, a demonstrable effectiveness of said vaccine in a domestic context. What is also unknown yet, is the impact of many of the transmission chains being linked to household-to-household contacts. That might give people even more cause for restraint.</p> <p>\u201cOur data indicates that protecting the health of others in the family, and the more vulnerable in the community, are bigger motivators than protecting a person\u2019s own health.\u201d</p> <p>Sydney\u2019s public transport patronage had only recovered to just over 60% of pre-Covid levels by May. Some of this is likely also due to changing habits.

Most rural communities depend directly on their land and forests for at least some of their needs. When that forest vanishes, or is stolen, the impacts are severe.\u201d</p> <p>While China\u2019s new forest law, which came into effect in July 2020, aims to promote sustainable trade of timber, as well as to safeguard China\u2019s forests, there are still concerns about some companies\u2019 practices.</p> <p> \u201cEven if the laws and rules change, it will take time and effective enforcement before the companies change behaviour,\u201d Stanley says.</p> <h2>Foreign-flagged fishing vessels</h2> <p>Fishing is a huge source of income for many small Pacific nations. But they largely haven\u2019t been able to capture the full value of this resource. Apart from Fiji, Pacific nations haven\u2019t been able to move up the value chain into the processing of fish into more valuable products.</p> <p>Kiribati, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.spc.int/sites/default/files/wordpresscontent/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gillett_16_Benefish-fisheries-in-economies-of-pacific-countries.pdf\">receives</a> up to 75% of its government revenue from fishing access fees and levies. But Kiribati directly exports very little \u2013 just 1,000 tonnes of seafood were exported to China in 2019. Foreign-flagged vessels, meanwhile, landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish in Kiribati waters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"102c305849a629905a914221adbdb1cd7a5ddb10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102c305849a629905a914221adbdb1cd7a5ddb10/0_0_5404_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese fishing boat detained by Palauan authorities on suspicion of illegally harvesting sea cucumber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese fishing boat detained by Palauan authorities on suspicion of illegally harvesting sea cucumber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Brooks/Lightning Strike Media Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A survey of boats operating in the Pacific in 2016 found that Chinese-flagged vessels far outstripped those of any other country.

Google has confirmed that this wouldn\u2019t affect any of the company\u2019s other services, such as YouTube, Gmail or Google drive.</p> <p>The threat came as Google\u2019s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/mel-silvas-opening-statement\">told a Senate committee</a> the new code would \u201cwould set an untenable precedent\u201d and create an \u201cunmanageable financial and operational risk\u201d if it were to become law.</p> <p>But while Google <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1004151/search-engine-usage-by-brand-in-australia\">can claim</a> upwards of 90% of the search market in Australia, there are <a href=\"https://alternativeto.net/software/google-search/\">many other search options available</a>, such as DuckDuckGo, Microsoft Bing, or Ecosia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/22/google-threatens-to-shut-down-search-in-australia-if-digital-news-code-goes-ahead\">Google threatens to shut down search in Australia if digital news code goes ahead</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What would it mean to not have Google search in Australia?</h2> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, preparing for that worst-case scenario would result in users landing on a Google search page when they put that URL in but then being presented with a screen that tells them we\u2019re unable to offer the service in Australia,\u201d Silva said when asked what it meant to \u201cstop making Google search available in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>Google has shut down services like this before. And for similar reasons. In 2014 Google <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/google-news-spain-publishing-fees-internet\">shut down its News service in Spain</a> after the government passed a law requiring Google to pay a fee for links and excerpts of news articles. Users were met with a simple message saying the service had been closed. In a similar fashion, Australians may have to change the default search engines on their phones and computers.</p> <p>But shutting down Google search could be highly disruptive not just to consumers. Google\u2019s search algorithm, combined with other products like Google Maps, enable it to provide contextual answers such as a local plumber, shop opening times and directions. Google also powers the search functions on many websites, including the Guardian.</p> <p>A more fragmented search market could also mean businesses have to actively work harder to be seen. They might have to ensure their services are compliant with a number of different search engines, and advertise across them. And the loss of localised results would likely make Google search results less relevant even for users who do find their way around a geo-block.</p> <h2>What are the alternatives to Google search?</h2> <p>Microsoft\u2019s Bing is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1004151/search-engine-usage-by-brand-in-australia\">second in the Australian search market</a> behind Google. It also powers Yahoo\u2019s search engine, which ranks third, as well as a number of other search engines. Launched about a decade ago, it is one of the best resourced competitors to Google and so one of the most full featured, having the ability to search with voice, and simple tools like timezones and a calculator.</p> <p>Another option, which some may remember from the 1990s, is <a href=\"https://www.dogpile.com/\">Dogpile.com</a>. It\u2019s a \u201cmeta search engine\u201d, which means it enables users to search multiple search engines at the same time. This can be useful as search engines all have strengths and weaknesses, either due to the resources available or their own policies.</p> <p>Because of Google\u2019s dominance, many search engines are built around a core idea, feature or principle. So depending on what your priorities are, there are a number of other options.</p> <p>DuckDuckGo is well known for being a privacy-oriented search engine. It claims not to collect or store personal information, or track users. The flipside of this, however, is a lack of personalisation. Theoretically we should all get similar results if we search for the same thing. Google searches for DuckDuckGo <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=AU&amp;q=Duck%20Duck%20Go\">appear to have ticked up</a> since the threat was made.</p> <p>Ecosia is a social business, runs on renewable energy and plants trees using the income from ads on its search results. \u201cIt costs roughly 0.25 \u20ac to plant a tree, which means that Ecosia can plant one tree every 50 searches,\u201d it <a href=\"https://ecosia.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201531072-How-does-Ecosia-neutralize-a-search-s-CO2-emissions-\">says on the website</a>. But it is also <a href=\"https://ecosia.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206153381-Where-do-Ecosia-s-search-results-come-from-\">powered by Bing</a>, which means the results should be comprehensive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/22/google-threatens-leave-australia-but-poker-face-slipping\">Google threatens to leave Australia \u2013 but its poker face is slipping</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What are the differences between Google and these other services?</h2> <p>Apart from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310591/apple-google-search-engine-safari-iphone-deal-billions-regulation-antitrust\">paying to be the default search engine</a> on some devices, Google search dominates because the results are comprehensive and we have just got used to it. So there would likely be a noticeable difference and some growing pains. Businesses may need to hold out and see which search engines come out on top, and then see what it takes to get their services ranking again.</p> <p>All of these search engines operate slightly differently, so there will be a learning curve. You may be used to simply typing in \u201cplumber\u201d or a stock market code, which Google can intuit based on contextual clues. In a different search engine you may have to tell it what suburb you\u2019re in. It may also help to try a couple of different search engines to see what gives you the best results.</p> <p>For advanced users, Google offers a bunch of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en\">search operations</a> which can make it easier to search specific sites or refine your results. Most search engines will have <a href=\"https://help.bing.microsoft.com/#apex/18/en/10002/-1\">similar functionality</a>, but the syntax will be slightly different. There will also be new toys to learn and play with, like <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/bang\">Bangs</a> on DuckDuckGo taking you straight to certain websites, or some of the contextual information Bing puts next to search results.</p> <p>Losing Google search might be a shock. But there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. </p> <ul> <li><p>Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new \u201cShowcase\u201d offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product.<br></p></li> </ul>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "news/datablog/2020/dec/22/interactive-map-which-areas-of-australia-were-hit-by-multiple-disasters-in-2020", "type": "article", "sectionId": "news", "sectionName": "News", "webPublicationDate": "2020-12-21T16:30:52Z", "webTitle": "Interactive map: which areas of Australia were hit by multiple disasters in 2020?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2020/dec/22/interactive-map-which-areas-of-australia-were-hit-by-multiple-disasters-in-2020", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2020/dec/22/interactive-map-which-areas-of-australia-were-hit-by-multiple-disasters-in-2020", "fields": {"headline": "Interactive map: which areas of Australia were hit by multiple disasters in 2020?", "byline": "Josh Nicholas and Nick Evershed", "body": "<p>It\u2019s fair to say 2020 has been a bad year for many, with few areas of Australia remaining untouched by some kind of disaster.</p> <p>First were the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/counting-the-cost-of-australias-summer-of-dread\">\u201cblack Summer\u201d bushfires that killed at least 33 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and blanketed towns and cities in toxic smoke</a>.</p> <p>The 2019-20 fires followed several years of drought, and began in one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature\">the driest and warmest years on record</a>. Climate scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature\">have said that climate change pushed what would have been a hot year into record territory</a>, driving heat extremes and the risk of deadly fires.</p> <p>The tropical storm season also ended later than normal and, when the drought broke in some areas, flooding followed from heavy rain. On top of this, we\u2019ve had a global coronavirus pandemic that has killed 908 Australians, infected many more, and plunged the country into a recession.</p> <p>This combination of events means some parts of the country have been hit by more than one disaster in a year, with some regions experiencing multiple disasters, one after the other.</p> <p>One of the hardest-hit areas was the Bega Valley, which has had five disaster declarations in ten months due to fires and floods.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost nearly 500 homes. Sadly four lives in the community were lost. And a large number of stock and businesses were burnt,\u201d says Leane Barnes, General Manager of Bega Valley Shire council.</p> <p>\u201cThen later on, when we had the first lot of floods, the rain that came has impacted burnt, devastated environments. [There] has been an exponential impact of the rain on those destroyed environments. And then in some of those rain events where our teams have been working on fixing burnt infrastructure, that would get washed away ... in the flood.\u201d</p> <p>A Guardian Australia analysis of areas affected by multiple disasters shows that New South Wales was particularly hard-hit \u2013 containing fifteen of the top twenty local government areas most affected by a combination of fire, flood, drought, storms and Covid-19.</p> <p>We have combined measures of drought, area burned in 2019-20, storms and flooding, Covid-19 cases and job losses to construct a \u201cmultiple disaster index\u201d to get a sense of where these events overlapped. Heatwaves have not been included due to difficulties in getting spatial data, but most of Australia experienced significant heatwaves in 2020.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note a few things about this index. It does not quantify the overall impact of the disasters (some were far worse than others in terms of lives lost, or the damage involved), it only attempts to measure where multiple disasters happened. Many events increased the risk of others, such as droughts leading into bushfires. And finally there are significant limitations to the data, which you can read more about below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker_v5/html/index.html?key=19ilsIG8LobFUe5H_uL50UIuEZ1WMEGBZXX-RcMiMuhE\" data-alt=\"Map of multiple disaster index\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker_v5/html/index.html?key=19ilsIG8LobFUe5H_uL50UIuEZ1WMEGBZXX-RcMiMuhE\">Map of multiple disaster index</a> </figure>  <p>Bega Valley shows how multiple disasters within a short time can exacerbate each other, a phenomenon that may become more common.

Of course, the Covid-19 pandemic, has affected everyone, although Victoria was worst hit in terms of cases, deaths and <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-work-hours/weekly-payroll-jobs-and-wages-australia/latest-release\">measures of job and wage loss</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v9/index.html?key=1Rn0TTg3o37sRpYG4BRgPEqgyjVKsoNc4WpD_qzdwTcU&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"results table\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v9/index.html?key=1Rn0TTg3o37sRpYG4BRgPEqgyjVKsoNc4WpD_qzdwTcU&location=docsdata\">results table</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are now seeing what we call compounding disasters. So we had the black summer fires in NSW and then that was immediately followed by quite significant flooding around Sydney. And then that was followed by the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Leck said.</p> <p>\u201cIn south-east Queensland they were dealing with bushfires through September and October. And then they were just starting to deal with the recovery around that when they moved into cyclone season.\u201d</p> <p>Over the final months of 2019 and into 2020 Noosa experienced two bushfires six weeks apart, severe storms and then the global pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d never had the bushfires like we experienced in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/10/peregian-homes-destroyed-after-ferocious-bushfire-rips-through-sunshine-coast-community\">Peregian</a> previously. It was unprecedented. So we realised for the first time that this urban area was under threat,\u201d Frank Wilkie, deputy mayor of Noosa Shire, said.</p> <p>While Queensland was not locked down to the same extent as NSW or Victoria, border closures and reduced travel impacted Noosa\u2019s tourism industry. Visitors from elsewhere in Queensland made up some of the slack, but Wilkie estimates around 1,200 people were let go on Hastings Street, in the heart of Noosa, alone.</p> <p>\u201c[The events] made us more aware of how vulnerable we are. How ready we have to be to respond at relatively short notice. And how we need to look out for each other more,\u201d says Wilkie.</p> <p>If natural disasters become more frequent, and we see more compounding, it will require rethinking many aspects of how we organise society. Noosa and Bega Valley councils are working on building resilience in their communities and changing policies.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are facing requires a whole of community, whole of government, whole of business effort to reduce risk across a whole range of domains,\u201d Leck said.</p> <p>\u201cSocial, physical, infrastructure, telecommunications and power supplies. We need to look at how we live on the landscape. Where we choose to live and we also need to think about the essential services that support us in those choices.\u201d</p> <h2>Notes and methods</h2> <p>The disaster index was constructed using a combination of the following data:</p> <p>The percentage of each LGA burned in 2019-20 based on the<a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/fed/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B9ACDCB09-0364-4FE8-9459-2A56C792C743%7D\"> National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset</a>. This data measures fire boundaries, and within those boundaries the severity of the fire can vary, and may contain unburned areas. It also covers northern Australia, where fires in the sparsely populated savannah areas can be considered part of the natural landscape dynamics. The risks posed by these northern fires are very different to the bushfires that occurred in eastern Australia in forested regions near more densely populated areas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-work-hours/weekly-payroll-jobs-and-wages-australia/latest-release\">Weekly Payroll Jobs and Wages in Australia</a> from the Australian Bureau of Statistics converted to LGA areas from SA3 using ABS correspondence files. Job losses are measured as a percentage change since 14 March.</p> <p>Drought areas are based on whether the government considers an LGA to be <a href=\"https://www.regional.gov.au/regional/programs/files/180_Eligible_DCP_Extension_LGAs.pdf\">eligible</a> for the Drought Communities Programme. This excludes areas which had low rainfall, but less economic exposure to the impacts of drought.</p> <p>Storm and flooding areas are based <a href=\"https://disasters.org.au/current-catastrophes/2020/2/10/cat202\">on postcodes declared by the Insurance Council of Australia to be within the February \u201ccatastrophe\u201d event</a>. Cyclone areas were those where an <a href=\"https://www.dfes.wa.gov.au/waemergencyandriskmanagement/emergencysituationdeclarations/Declarations/Emergency-Situation-Declaration-TC-Damien-9-February-2020.pdf\">emergency situation was declared by the Western Australian government</a>.</p> <p>Covid case counts come from each state and territory\u2019s health department, however counts by LGA were not available for Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. For the purposes of the index, cases for each LGA were averaged from total cases in the state.</p> <p>Overseas-acquired Covid-19 cases were excluded from cumulative counts where possible.</p> <p>Each measure was normalised to create a number between one (the highest number in the dataset) and zero (the lowest). These were then added to make an index representing multiple disasters.</p> <p>We were unable to obtain heatwave spatial data and thus haven\u2019t included it in the index, but significant heatwaves occurred in January 2020 and November 2020, affecting most of the continent.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}]
