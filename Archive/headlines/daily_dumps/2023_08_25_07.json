It then sat on the notice paper for months.\nThat all changed at 3.29pm on Wednesday when minister for police Mark Ryan stood up in parliament to announce 57 pages of amendments to the bill \u2013 with minutes\u2019 notice.\nNow the bill would change everything from the operation of a north Queensland mining lease to the policing of sex workers, as well as requiring the suspension of the state\u2019s Human Rights Act, to allow for children to be kept indefinitely in adult watch houses.\nBut by introducing the changes so late in the process, the government ensured they wouldn\u2019t be scrutinised by parliamentary committees as most bills are.\nHere\u2019s a list of the 14 amendments attached to the bill and passed by Queensland\u2019s parliament on Thursday.\nThe first amendment removed the requirement for offenders on the sex crimes registry to report the location of every digital device they own or have access.\nThe government acted on longstanding inquiry recommendations, decriminalising the offences of begging and public drunkenness. The offences have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Queenslanders and homeless people, and are perceived as criminalising people for simply being poor. Minister Ryan said \u201cthese behaviours require a health and social welfare-based response\u201d rather than a criminal one.\nIn a related amendment, the laws limit the ability of police to punish people for public urination. Police will retain the power to issue an infringement notice to a person for public urination, in order to protect business in the CBD and the nightclub district of Fortitude Valley, according to Ryan\u2019s speech.\nThe government also moved to overturn a decision by the Queensland court of appeal which prevented it from imposing disciplinary sanctions on a number of police officers. The cops had to be reappointed to their sometimes senior positions as a result of a \u201ctechnical error\u201d in the way they were referred to the office of state discipline, Ryan said.\nThe next amendment implements a recommendation of the 2021 inquiry into legalising sex work in Queensland. The bill will now eliminate the power of police to move on a sex worker for soliciting, and eliminate covert powers relevant to sex work. Ryan said the reform was a step towards legalising sex work entirely.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They successfully argued the death of Perrett and other witnesses meant it could no longer obtain the material it needed to prepare a defence and fairly participate in the trial, despite allegations from the survivors\u2019 lawyers that it had ample opportunity to anticipate and prepare for civil claims while Perret was alive.\nThe diocese has known he was a convicted child abuser since 1995, heard a confession from Perrett that he was a paedophile in 2016, and knew of more criminal charges against him in 2017, three years before his death. Those charges included the allegations made by the two Indigenous men who later sued, though the church says it was oblivious to their identity.\nAn investigation by the Guardian earlier this year revealed the church and other institutions are now routinely seeking permanent stays where perpetrators have died, a strategy widely condemned \u2013 including by the former head of the church\u2019s response to the royal commission, Francis Sullivan \u2013 as a moral failing, a failure of leadership and another layer of abuse for survivors.\nPlaintiff lawyers say the threat of permanent stays is also being used during settlement negotiations to force survivors to accept paltry sums or risk having their cases halted permanently by the courts.\nRoss Koffel, managing principal at Koffels Solicitors & Barristers, which represented the two survivors in the Perrett case, said the need for reform was clear.\nThe high court is expected to soon hand down a landmark judgment in one stay case, that of GLJ, which could potentially change the way stays are treated by Australian courts.\n\u201cSubject to what happens in GLJ with the high court, if that doesn\u2019t provide some relief against the applications that are being made, then it requires legislative intervention,\u201d Koffel told the Guardian. \u201cThere is little doubt that the way in which the stay cases have progressed means that the so-called extraordinary circumstances have been applied to ordinary cases, and I think that\u2019s the very problem.\u201d\nThe Australian Lawyers Alliance spokesperson and barrister Dr Andrew Morrison KC said he believes reform will be needed regardless of what happens in the high court.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of continuing concern and New South Wales is easily the worst place in Australia on permanent stays, with Queensland a little distance behind,\u201d he said.\nThe deaths of witnesses is common in historical abuse cases, as is the absence of records.\nThat is partly due to the length of time survivors take to come forward \u2013 22 years, on average \u2013 and partly due to the church\u2019s own role in concealing abuse complaints.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As in, literally assassinate him.\nDonald just said they were savage animals and left it there, hanging in the Twitter/X space like the promise of self-driving Teslas.\nSure, sure. There was plenty of weird stuff from Donald. He called Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor, \u201cAda\u201d, and described Hutchinson as a seriously nasty thing that was so nasty he couldn\u2019t explain why. He called Chris Christie a lunatic. He said Joe Biden couldn\u2019t walk on grass or sand.\nHe even claimed to have saved the Tokyo Olympics by getting North Korean athletes to take part. Which is the kind of thing that can haunt you, late at night, if you try too hard to understand what he\u2019s saying.\nBut then Tucker said Biden had skinny legs, and Kamala Harris was senile too, and that one of his old Fox News co-workers was a small man. He even claimed that Trump\u2019s indictments weren\u2019t \u201cworking\u201d because Trump\u2019s poll numbers were going up.

So it looks like we're having three years of breeding failure, which is unsustainable if it carries on like this,\" Dr Fretwell said.\nWhy shrinking sea ice threatens emperor penguins\nFor years scientists have warned that global warming could lead to the demise of emperor penguins, because the sea ice they depend on for breeding and raising their young is shrinking.\nIn their breeding cycle, babies usually hatch about August. They then are supported by their parents until November or December when their waterproof feathers have grown, and they can fend for themselves.\nIf the sea ice melts before the chicks grow their waterproof feathers, they either drown or freeze to death.

( Australia's Guide. )\nThe sport's collective memories are stored towards the end of Allowrie Street, across the road from a bus stop and a grocery store.\nThe place \u2014 known simply as Jamberoo Pub \u2014 has an anonymity that makes its own kind of sense.\nThis is how the Australian game has always felt: something out of the way, hidden from public view, its secrets and stories known only to those who are already part of their telling.\nEven before you step inside, you can feel history beckoning: a Matildas flag taped to a window, a sun-faded yellow shirt listing the names of football's pioneers nailed to a corkboard.\nThe pub is owned by the Warren family, whose late patriarch Johnny was known as \"Captain Socceroo\": one of the leading voices in the Australian game from his time as a player in the 1960s and 70s to his time as a coach, pundit, and broadcaster with SBS until his death in 2004.\nJohnny Warren receives the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit from Sepp Blatter in 2004. ( Jon Buckle: Getty Images )\nWarren was a true disciple of the world game: a genuine believer in its power to create change, and fiercely committed to the idea that Australia could, one day, become a football nation.\n\"We've got to stop talking about when we're going to qualify [for World Cups],\" he once famously said after being awarded an Order of Merit from FIFA.\n\"We've got to start talking about when we're going to win World Cups.\n\"Champion teams beat teams of champions, and there's a big lesson there for Australian soccer.\n\"I want Australia to embrace this fabulous game. It's not wog-ball; this is the game of the world.\"\nThe front room of the pub, which is now run by Johnny's nephew Jamie, is like stepping back through time: the walls and ceilings are plastered with photos and jerseys and posters and flags, rusted trophies and yellowing knick-knacks crowding every surface in sight.\nThe hallway down the middle is a gallery lined with newspaper clippings and portraits of past generations of Socceroos, each of them gazing triumphantly out from their frames, watching down over whoever is destined to come after them.\nBut the back room of the pub is the most magnificent place of all.\nThe corridor opens into a big empty space of tables and chairs where, no matter which one you sit in, you can see the story of Australian football unfold before your eyes.\nOne corner of the Johnny Warren Football Museum inside the Jamberoo Pub.

( Supplied. )\nAnd yet, for the better part of a century, the mythology of Australian football has remained hidden at the end of a quiet road, at the back of a quiet pub: pushed to the side by an Anglo-Australian culture that has, until recently, been suspicious or outright hostile towards whatever didn't look, sound or feel like them.\nWarren spent much of his 61 years of life fighting to have football recognised across the country, not only by governments, businesses and media, but also by the wider public.\nHe and former SBS broadcaster Les Murray, a Hungarian-born migrant who moved to Australia in 1957 and immediately found identity and community through football, became known as \"Mr and Mrs Soccer\" for their constant advocacy on behalf of the game on programs like The World Game and On The Ball, which brought the international game into Australian homes.\nWarren's 2002 book titled \"Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters\" was one of the first to lay out the deep cultural connections between football and the changing face of Australia after World War II, with the title referring to the common insults those who played the game would receive throughout the mid-20th century.\nThere have been moments in which the game has threatened to crack through the ceiling of mainstream consciousness: the height of the old National Soccer League, the Socceroos' defeat of Uruguay to break their World Cup curse in 2005, the peak years of the A-League Men.\nBut football has never really stuck, often pulled backwards by its own cultural self-cannibalism and messy political in-fighting, while also struggling to stay relevant to those who, for one reason or another, believe that our national sport looks and sounds and feels like something else.\nThe Socceroos' defeat of Uruguay to qualify for their first World Cup in 32 years was a moment of national celebration. ( AAP Image: Mick Tsikas )\nAnd so football has turned inward, trying desperately to keep itself alive; lashing out at all those who would threaten it like a starving, frightened animal backed into a corner.\nThe women's game has been even more hidden, boxed away in cupboards and offices and garages across the country; so many of its stories surviving only in the memories of the women who were there to see for themselves.\nBut despite all of that, Warren's faith in the power of the game never wavered. He knew what this sport was capable of, so long as everybody within it saw the same picture.\nBefore his death from lung cancer in 2004, he was asked what he wanted his legacy to be.\n\"I told you so,\" was his now-famous answer.\n\"We've campaigned for so long, we've beaten against doors of trying to have the game accepted.\n\"We're this great sporting nation who has yet to embrace fully the world's greatest game.\"\nAs the sun sets on the 2023 Women's World Cup, what would Warren have said as he watched his beloved sport finally capture the hearts and minds of a nation that he always believed it would?\nThe numbers are one thing: almost 2 million tickets sold; record viewership on television and online streaming; newspapers and TV bulletins splashed with the faces and stories of the Matildas; green-and-gold jerseys swept off the racks by fans old and new.\nBut the feeling is another thing altogether. There is a feeling that something fundamental has shifted within the sport and as a country, where football has become the thing Warren and so many others always hoped it could be.\nWhat would Warren have thought that the seismic shift was triggered not just by football, but women's football: a segment of the game that has been even more neglected and overshadowed due to intersecting attitudes of sexism and homophobia, and has had to overcome so many more obstacles over the past century to finally get its moment in the sun?\nWhat would he have said knowing that Australia's captain is a queer woman of colour, whose goal against England in the team's first ever semifinal will be seared into the memories of generations of fans? A woman who has always used her voice to echo the spirit he was known for: believing deep in her bones that this sport is not just a sport, but a platform for change, for opportunity, for inclusion, for community.\nHow would he have felt knowing his spirit accompanied the Matildas throughout the World Cup? It was written in big bold letters across a banner carried by the team's active support group at each of their games, floating alongside a phrase the Matildas themselves adopted but that equally applies to the sport they are now front-and-centre of: \"never say die\".\nEach of the 23 players who represented Australia in this momentous month has represented the soul of football in their own unique way, from advocating for our domestic women's league to battling imposter syndrome to emerging from the wilderness of doubt and defeat to stand tall and take up space and become heroes in their own right.\nThis is a team, led by a head coach in Tony Gustavsson, who believed in themselves all the way to the end. Even when hope was at its lowest ebb, they turned inward in order to survive, knowing that their suffering was all part of a bigger purpose that no-one else could see.\nMatildas fans have carried Australian football's two most iconic sayings on banners to every game. ( Supplied. )\nThis is a group of women who know the power of being inspired, and carry that responsibility with them wherever they go. They know that they are only here for a short while \u2014 \"renting the jersey,\" as they say, and not owning it \u2014 and recognise their role in connecting the past with the future.\nAnd they know, now, that this World Cup is no longer about them.\nThey have done their part, giving everything of themselves to us and to each other, understanding that every goal and every pass and every tackle and every save will echo in the memory of someone out there who will point back one day and talk about how this was where their footballing dreams began.\n\"The only thing that's keeping me smiling right now is the way that we've inspired the nation,\" Sam Kerr said after their semifinal loss to England.\n\"I think the crowds and the fans have proved it, not us. They're the ones that have come out and supported us and watched us on the big screen and bought our jerseys.\n\"That's all down to the fans showing that this country really will get behind football if you bring the world game here.\n\"Hopefully this tournament changes that, because that's the legacy you leave: not what you do on the pitch, the legacy is what you do off the pitch.\n\"Hopefully this is the start of something new.\"\nKerr is right: it is not just this team that makes Australia a football nation. It's all of us.\nEvery time we pull on our boots and take a ball down to the local park, every time we flick on the television or click on a story, every time we buy a match ticket or wear a raggedy old jersey, every time we celebrate with a stranger or console with a friend.\nThe past month has been a living echo of Johnny Warren's words, belief and aspiration made deeply and achingly real, the idea of who we could be finally coming true.\nThe Matildas have helped us see something we have always believed about ourselves. ( AAP Image: Jono Searle )\nAustralian football's biggest battle has always been for relevance: of trying to show the rest of the country not just how this game looks, but how this game feels.\nThe Matildas' run has encapsulated it all, from the nervous beginning against Republic of Ireland to the hopeless loss to Nigeria, the heart-thumping come-back against Canada to the purposeful dismantling of Denmark, the game of destiny against France to the games of disappointment against England and Sweden.\nThey have allowed us to experience the edges and ebbs of hope and heartbreak, to hold every thrilling moment in our hearts and in our throats, to feel our minds racing and our chests pumping and our lungs burning as though we are down on that field with them, passing and tackling and sprinting through the night.\nThey have allowed us to feel the ecstasy of this beautiful game, its joys and its sorrows, its doors opening and closing, its ability to pull us all out of ourselves and make us part of some bigger thing: this communion of old and new worshippers, brought together in cathedrals of colour and sound, turning us into the true believers of what football can do and be and feel like. The dream made suddenly and miraculously real.\nThe road to Australian football's past may be easily missed, but the road to its future has never looked so clear and bright.\nThe Matildas may not have won the World Cup this time, as Warren always thought they could.

They also believe that these people are harvesting an adrenaline-like substance from children to attain eternal life. Former US President Donald Trump is also thought by followers to be waging a secret battle against this \u201cdeep state\u201d scheme.\nIt hasn't helped that lead actor Caviezel has repeated several QAnon phrases on conservative talk shows like \"andrenochroming,\" the false term used to describe the extraction of a substance from child victims to harvest the elixir of youth. He has also used other language of the movement (\"a big storm is coming\") and in 2021, attended a QAnon-adjacent conference.\nAside from QAnon believers, the movie is being championed by other notable conservative figures like Trump, who hosted a viewing party at his golf course with Caviezel and the agent who inspired his role in attendance.\nMonteverde, who did not attend, said the political ties from others were hurting his film, and he prefers to keep his distance.\nThe second controversy: Misleading portrayals of child trafficking\nIn Sound of Freedom, Caviezel as Ballard takes on a crime syndicate in Colombia after children are snatched by strangers.\nThis depiction has stoked concern from human and child trafficking experts who say while people can be kidnapped by strangers and trafficked, it's not the typical way it's done.\nREAD MORE My daughter was taken by a sex trafficker and now has a price tag on her\nTypically, it's done by someone who knows the person and exploits that trust.

Before distributing original content, Angel Studios made its brand by removing nudity, swearing and violence from mainstream movies and shows before it was sued by a number of well-known Hollywood studios for copyright.\nTo raise the $5m ($7.8m) the company needed to distribute and market the film, it crowdfunded the money from \"angel\" investors.\nOne of the film's many investors, Fabian Marta, was arrested on 23 July and charged as an accessory for child kidnapping in the US state of Missouri, NewsWeek reported. While the details of the case are not public, this charge carries a penalty of 10 to 30 years in prison or life imprisonment.\nThe fourth controversy: The Pay-It-Forward sales are misleading\nIt's true the film has been unexpectedly popular, grossing more than the latest Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones movies in the US.\nBut some of these sales are being called into question.\nIn the film's closing credits, the hero of the film, Caviezel, asks viewers to \u201c pay it forward \u201d by buying someone else a ticket.

Source: Getty / Maskot\nEconomy to slow, some costs to blow out\nLike other countries in the OECD (a group of 38 countries with advanced economies), economic growth is also expected to slow, largely as a result of the above.\nAnd spending in certain key areas - aged care, the NDIS, health, defence, and interest on the nation's debt - is set to balloon.\nThose five currently account for around a third of government spending, but that's set to rise to roughly half.\nWorkers carrying more of tax burden\nRegular workers are set to pick up a greater chunk of the tax burden over the next decade.\nThat's because the budget will come to more heavily rely on personal income tax, with GST and company tax set to remain stable.\nA proportionately smaller pool of working-age Australians, supporting a higher proportion of retirees needing health and aged care, will put extra pressure on the budget.\nThere'll also be a longer-term shift in where government can source its money.\nLabor has long encouraged Australians to buy electric vehicles, and the shift away from regular cars is expected to accelerate this decade partly due to tax incentives. But fewer petrol cars means the government recouping less from taxes on petrol.\nThere's also been a consistent decline in the number of young Australians taking up smoking. If that trend continues, that again means less revenue from taxing cigarettes. That was worth about $14 billion in 2020-21.\nGeopolitical risks to increase\nIncreasing tensions in our region will pose challenges for decades.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare weaknesses in the global supply chains, the IGR also notes that trade and investment have increasingly been used as \"tools of statecraft\".\nAustralia has certainly borne the brunt of that, after a series of trade sanctions imposed on its exports by China.\nThe report says that dynamic is likely to deepen, something that will require \"unprecedented\" coordination between Australia's domestic policy, foreign policy, and national security arms.\nAnd a hot war in the Indo-Pacific would have \"far-reaching consequences\" for our economy, it warns.", "Matches": "16", "Num matches": 1.0}, {"publication":

The former president\u2019s arrival in Georgia follows a presidential debate featuring his main rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination, a race in which Trump remains the overwhelmingly dominant frontrunner despite his many legal troubles. Trump had his legal team negotiate his booking to take place during the primetime viewing hours for the cable news networks, as he sought to discredit the charges and distract from the indignity of the surrender by turning it into a spectacle. But Trump was expected to be booked by authorities without the special privileges afforded to him in his other criminal cases, being subject to a mugshot that he had desperately sought to avoid, having his fingerprints taken, as well as having his height and weight recorded.

Two days ago he asked a federal court in an emergency motion to block his arrest, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. He asked the court to \u201cprotect\u201d him from arrest before a Monday 28 August, hearing on his request to move the case out of the Fulton county superior court to the district court of northern Georgia. Meadows is arguing that the charges against him concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. Trump is expected to argue likewise in due course. In response, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis unequivocally rejected the request, noting: \u201cI am not granting any extensions\u201d and that he was no different from any other defendant in a criminal case. Willis indicated that if Meadows does not turn himself in by noon on Friday, he would be arrested, writing: \u201cAt 12:30 pm on Friday I shall file warrants in the system.\u201d Early Thursday afternoon, he surrendered to the jail to be booked.

One can think of nothing worse: babies who were grievously ill, killed or injured by a woman who was meant to care for them. Why was Letby able to kill so many young victims? Why wasn\u2019t she recognised as a murderer sooner?\nSome are saying that Letby\u2019s case is a \u201cone-off\u201d, and is thus difficult to process or learn from. While serial murder is rare, to those of us in the field of serial homicide research, the crimes and victims of Letby are less surprising. In many ways, Letby fits the profile for the \u201ctypical\u201d female serial killer (FSK) that my team and I compiled for The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology in 2015. By analysing cases in the US, we found that nearly 40% of female serial killers are nurses, nurses\u2019 aides or other healthcare workers.\nOur analysis showed that a FSK is likely to be white, probably Christian, average looking or attractive, and in her 20s or 30s when the crimes start. She has an elevated probability of being a healthcare worker, often in charge of caring for those who are helpless. Those familiar to her are at risk, especially vulnerable people such as infants and the sick. She may murder for money or power. She may be arrogant or at times withdrawn, and may have experienced a recent relationship issue. Experts such as Eric Hickey and Patricia Pearson have also compiled information about FSK backgrounds, crimes, motives and victims.\nThe caveat is that a forensic profile is an imperfect predictor of future crimes, and the description above probably applies to many nurses you know. Moreover, almost every nurse or medical professional who has ever lived would never harm anyone. We created a composite FSK profile based on frequencies and trends in previous cases that we hoped would serve as a starting point \u2013 a statistical tool for investigating suspected female-perpetrated serial homicide offences.\nIn fairness, too, Letby did not check some of the boxes in our profile. Most FSKs have been married; Letby never was. Most FSKs do not keep souvenirs of their crimes; Letby kept bags of patient records and a diary with victim initials and their death dates. In our analysis we found a documented history of mental illness in about 40% of FSK cases. I have seen no reports yet that Letby has such a history. Many FSKs had parental issues. It is my understanding that Letby\u2019s parents were supportive to the point of attending her trial every day. Yet the profile is a starting point for whom and what to look for when serial murder is suspected.\nSo how can we make sure that law enforcement and the public have access to what we know about FSKs as an investigative tool? My 2015 article about FSKs is reported to be the most-read article in the journal\u2019s history. But the point is moot if the information isn\u2019t disseminated to people who can use it. We can try to do better.\nIt does seem bewildering that administrators at Countess of Chester hospital failed to recognise Letby\u2019s crimes after doctors raised concerns . Some outlets have put the hospital\u2019s reaction down to a \u201ca culture of arrogance\u201d. As a research psychologist, however, I can offer a different perspective, and one that I offer to law enforcement when given the opportunity to engage with them.\nWe all have a \u201cschema\u201d \u2013 a cognitive framework \u2013 of how people, places and things typically operate to help us process the world around us. We create each schema from the slew of information we have encountered in our previous experiences. Evidence repeatedly shows that we find it very difficult to process or believe information that does not fit our schemas. We have a schema for \u201cnurse\u201d. A nurse is a skilled and compassionate caretaker. A nurse monitors, nourishes and soothes. \u201cKiller\u201d does not fit into our \u201cnurse\u201d schema.\nMore broadly, we also have a gender schema. Fairly or not, people have a preconceived notion of what we feel a \u201cwoman\u201d and a \u201cman\u201d ought to be, based on our previous encounters and feedback. Evidence shows that, throughout history, women are typically perceived as nurturing, caring and kind. Most people are not ready to believe that a woman can kill.\nNow think of \u201cfemale nurse\u201d, and how \u201cmurderer\u201d is probably brushed off as being impossible.\nThe initial failures of the Countess of Chester hospital echoes what we have seen in previous FSK cases. Other hospital-based serial killers such as Kristen Gilbert, Reta Mays and Genene Jones killed multiple helpless victims before hospital authorities realised that the deaths were unnatural. When I give training talks to law enforcement (while acknowledging that their crime-solving skills are exponentially more developed than mine), I challenge them to drop their schemas. If you think a woman will not kill or a nurse will not kill, then think again.\nOn the heels of the Letby case, what can we do to stop this type of homicide, or at least to limit the number of future victims? As mentioned previously, we can become aware of the science out there, and perhaps we in the scientific community can do a better job of disseminating information. In addition, we can learn to look beyond our preconceived notions of who a murderer might be. One must be ready and willing to recognise that a crime is happening, even if the suspect seems unlikely based on our preconceived ideas.\nOf Letby, Detective Ch Insp Nicola Evans said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything outstanding or outrageous about her as a person.\u201d This is reminiscent of the Mays case in West Virginia in the US, when District Judge Thomas Kleeh, sentencing Mays to life in prison for murdering seven elderly veterans under her hospital care, told her: \u201cYou are the monster no one sees coming.\u201d We must be prepared to recognise that, sometimes, the monster is a vanilla nurse who took dance lessons, fancied a staff doctor, and had teddy bears, fairy lights and a polka-dot dressing gown in her bedroom; an otherwise ordinary woman who took salsa lessons and a holiday with friends in Ibiza, and yet destroyed lives in a most extraordinary way.", "Matches": "10", "Num matches": 1.0}, {"publication": "ABC", "scraped_datetime": "06AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "One of China\u2019s richest women is an elusive billionaire heiress.

( Reuters: Tingshu Wang )\nWith less easy money available, the sector \u2014 which accounts for more than a quarter of China's GDP, according to some estimates \u2014 has struggled to pay its bills.\nLast year, hundreds of mostly small developers filed for bankruptcy, according to a note by Andrew Collier from Orient Capital Research.\nAdditionally, after years of incredible demand for housing, the market is cooling and millions of apartments are sitting empty.\nAs the crisis worsened, property giant Evergrande began to show signs of distress, missing bond payments and triggering speculation its downfall could have flow on effects as the world grappled with the economic consequences of the pandemic.\nAfter nearly two years in limbo, it filed for bankruptcy protection last week in the US, not long after Country Garden revealed it owes $US200 billion.\nUnlike Evergrande, Country Garden's woes largely came as a surprise.\n\"It had always been seen as less risky property developer,\" said Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.\n\"The belief was that for Country Garden, because the distribution of [its] land bank tended to be in favourable places, their sales would not suffer, and they should be able to repay their debt.\n\"But I think one of the underlying dynamics that's very interesting here is that unlike in previous downturns in the real estate market \u2026 we are seeing prices drop even in Shanghai, and Shanghai property prices have basically been on an upward trajectory without any interruption.\"\nIf Country Garden misses the deadline for the end of its grace period, the company and its shareholders risk being sued by its creditors.\nBut even if they do find the money, its problems are far from over says Mr Howie.\n\"It will only be a matter of time because the underlying problem remains, [that being] the property market is broken,\" he said.\nOne of Asia's richest woman has her fortune cut in half\nLess than two years ago, Ms Yang was worth an estimated $US30 billion, making her Asia's richest woman by a long shot, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.\nBut her fortune has been cut by more than half in a matter of months, after Country Garden sought to raise cash by selling discounted shares last year, as China was gripped by a mortgage boycott.\nAt some sites construction has slowed or completely stopped, with workers telling Reuters they haven't been paid since January \u2013 although a statement from the company disputed this.\nIt's estimated Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to finish, but it said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it would \"spare no effort\" to fulfil its orders.\n\"The Company will effectively ensure the operation of projects nationwide and complete the tasks of property delivery by implementing its main responsibilities, utilising funds according to their specific purposes and strictly controlling pre-sale monitoring funds etc., so as to fulfil its commitment to property owners,\" the statement read.\nCountry Garden is now the equivalent of a Hong Kong penny stock, with the share price having plunged more than 70 per cent this year.\nIts woes could be a sign that the heiress has lost some of her political clout, expert suggest.\n\"I think she once was very, very connected, could call up very senior officials and get different things done but I suspect that may not be the case so much anymore,\" Professor Shih said.\n\"Because if Country Garden still had that kind of political clout, none of this would have been necessary in the first place.\n\"The one thing about an overseas bankruptcy or distress situation, is that everyone knows it would immediately be covered by global media, and the whole world would know it, and also that information will go back to the top leadership through different channels \u2026 so it really is a sure way to get the leadership's attention.\"\nChina's property sector accounts for more than a quarter of China's GDP, according to some estimates. ( Reuters: Tingshu Wang )\nAnd while Ms Yang's fortune is declining, it's also under increasing scrutiny.\nEarlier this month, the company announced Ms Yang had donated more than half her stake in the company \u2014 worth more than $US800 million \u2014 to a family charity.\nThe practice has become more common among China's super wealthy as a result of a Chinese Communist Party policy called \"Common Prosperity\".\nWhile it is not clearly defined, the policy is generally understood to involve reducing the gap between China's elite and its poorest citizens.\n\"There's no tax distribution, there was actually no economic policies whatsoever to support Common Prosperity,\" explained Mr Collier.\n\"However, the ability to use that to grab money from the large capitalist firms is the key to it.\"\nSome of China's major companies \u2014 including Ali Baba and a lot of big tech firms \u2014 have set up charities in recent years, he said.\n\"One gets a sense that basically the regime, including the provincial governors, are so desperate for money that they'll just go to whoever has it \u2026 [and] the government may simply say, 'Well, you know, we want that money' and they'll just take it,\" he said.\n'Building more houses doesn't solve your problems'\nAfter strict COVID controls were lifted at the end of last year, there were hopes that China's economy would jump back to life and in turn provide a shot in the arm for the global economy.\nBut they have been well and truly dashed in recent months, with property far from the country's only economic problem.\nFor years, developers have put up large apartment blocks in isolated parts of China. ( Reuters: Lusha Zhang )\nSome huge trusts operating as shadow banks have missed repayments and one in five young people are unemployed, a situation which has become so bad that the Chinese government has stopped publishing data on youth unemployment.\nOfficially the Chinese Government said it needed to review its methodology for the measure.\nOn the back of the latest Evergrande and Country Garden news, stocks in Hong Kong \u2014 made up largely of mainland Chinese companies \u2014 last week plunged more than 20 per cent below the most recent peak.\nTypically Chinese homebuyers purchase a property before it's completed, meaning some are now servicing mortgages for homes with an uncertain future.\nWith many cash-strapped Chinese developers now on shaky footing, there are fears this may have knock-on effects on ongoing builds of pre-sold housing projects, exacerbating an already diminishing confidence among the wider public.\nWhile this is yet to play out, the Chinese cultural belief that money would be safe in houses is being put to the test, according to Mr Howie.\n\"Where we now find ourselves after 20 plus years of this [economic growth is] there simply is a huge oversupply of property, particularly in the lower tier cities, where building has well outstripped demand,\" he said.\n\"[Now] you've got people who don't necessarily have enough money to spend or are wanting to save their money, a job market that is much tighter, you simply don't have the demand you had before,\" he said.\n\"And so the previous model of selling properties to new buyers, and that will fund the future development is starting to fall apart.\"\nThere have been various predictions of a stimulus announcement by the CCP, but so far any responses have been conservative.\n\"I think the capacity for China to have a big stimulus is much more limited than it was in the past,\" says Mr Howie.\n\"You also have the problem that stimulus no longer works in the way it once did, if you've got too many roads, bridges and houses, building more of them doesn't solve any of your problems.\"", "Matches": "1", "Num matches": 1.0}]
