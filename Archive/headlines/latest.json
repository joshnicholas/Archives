More significantly for Putin, Prigozhin\u2019s rebellion, which reached the outskirts of Moscow, exposed the fragility of a regime many deemed to be stable.\nThe cause of the crash on Wednesday, which killed all 10 people on board \u2013 Prigozhin listed among them, officials said \u2013 was not immediately clear, but the Wagner leader\u2019s longstanding feud with the military and the armed uprising he led in June would give the Russian state ample motive for revenge.\n01:03 Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin on crashed plane, Russian aviation authority confirms \u2013 video\nPutin does not suffer betrayal gladly and is known to divide those who oppose him into two categories: enemies and traitors. Prigozhin\u2019s uprising undoubtedly placed him in the second category.\nBut Putin\u2019s initial response to the mutiny left many puzzled. Despite promising to \u201cliquidate the traitor\u201d in a televised address to the nation, Putin allowed Prigozhin to strike a deal with Belarus\u2019s Alexander Lukashenko and leave Russia for exile.\nUnusually, weeks after the mutiny, the Kremlin said Putin had a three-hour meeting with Prigozhin and Wagner group commanders days after the rebellion.\nPutin also remarkably admitted that he sought and failed during the meeting to have Prigozhin replaced as the leader of Wagner\u2019s fighters in Ukraine.\nHaving initially left for Belarus, where his Wagner troops set up camp and trained local security forces, Prigozhin was seen moving freely back and forth between Moscow and his home town of St Petersburg, reportedly picking up stacks of cash and gold bars that he held at his opulent mansions.\nNot much later, Prigozhin was spotted on the sidelines of a major Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg, where he met African officials at a hotel that he owned.\nThose who knew Prigozhin were not surprised, believing that the warlord at some point would probably pick up the tab for his foray into revolutionary politics. A former restaurant tycoon turned mercenary leader, Prigozhin has always been a risk-taker, and was not one to sit in exile in Belarus while his mercenary army was dismantled.\nAttempting to explain Putin\u2019s timid behaviour, analysts argued that the Russian leader, who had not previously faced dissent from the ultra-nationalist flank, was looking to pacify rather than destroy his former ally.\nBut Prigozhin\u2019s brazen conduct left many in the elite wondering whether Putin still held control over the country, according to western officials.\n\u201cFor a lot of Russians watching this, used to this image of Putin as the arbiter of order, the question was, \u2018Does the emperor have no clothes?\u2019 Or at least, \u2018Why is it taking so long for him to get dressed?\u2019\u201d CIA director William Burns said earlier this month.\nPrigozhin was last seen earlier this week when he released a video in which he claimed to be in Africa, where his mercenaries have relocated since the abortive uprising. But it was unclear when it was taken and whether he had returned to Russia since it was shot.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While his uprising was largely condemned by the armed forces, he remained a popular figure among some elements of the troops who sympathised with his critiques of the Russian military establishment and the faltering war.\n\u201cIf he is really dead, [I will] grab my stuff, we don\u2019t need this fucking war,\u201d wrote Egor Guzenko, a Russian soldier who runs a blog under the callsign \u201cThirteenth\u201d shortly after the news of Prigozhin\u2019s death emerged.\n\u201cWe should be killing our enemies, not our own,\u201d wrote Sergei Markov, a popular blogger and former adviser to the Kremlin. \u201cAll our enemies are celebrating \u2026 The death of Priogzhin is Ukraine\u2019s biggest achievement this year.\u201d\nThe crash of Prigozhin\u2019s jet also comes on the day that reports emerged indicating that Moscow had relieved Gen Sergei Surovikin of his command of the Russian aerospace forces, in the highest-level sacking yet of a military commander after Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny.\nPrigozhin\u2019s public support for Surovikin, a veteran commander who was seen as an ally of the Wagner militia in the Russian defence ministry, had raised questions over whether he or other senior commanders aided the mutiny or at least had prior knowledge of Prigozhin\u2019s plans.\nWhile the dramatic crash footage was met with shock by his allies, some in the Russian establishment previously indicated that Putin would not let Prigozhin\u2019s betrayal slide.\nIn an earlier interview with the Guardian, a Kremlin insider said that \u201cin half a year or a year, novichok will catch up with Prigozhin,\u201d a reference to the 2020 poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will be easily forgiven \u2026 Maybe not immediately, but in some time, in the best traditions, novichok will come to visit him. He should probably watch out for his underpants,\u201d the source added.\nPutin, however, appears to have been working to a fast-track schedule.\nIt seems certain that those in the political elite will take onboard one crucial lesson from the turbulent summer of 2023: \u201cYou come at the king, you best not miss.\u201d", "Matches": "34,19,17,14", "Num matches": 4}, {"publication": "SBS", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "What Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's death could mean for the war in Ukraine", "Url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/what-the-wagner-chiefs-death-could-mean-for-the-war-in-ukraine/erzfp72i3", "Rank": 3, "Text": "Perhaps the most unexpected thing about the plane crash that reportedly killed Yevgeny Prigozhin , the bombastic head of Russia\u2019s infamous Wagner group, is that it happened a full two months after he brought Russia to what President Vladimir Putin warned at the time was the brink of civil war.\nPrigozhin certainly seemed to be living on borrowed time. His bizarre revolt against Russia\u2019s military leadership, which saw an armoured Wagner convoy proceed largely unchallenged through southern Russia until it stopped just short of Moscow, flew in the face of the twin rules for survival in Putin\u2019s Russia.\nOne, you don\u2019t rock the boat. Two, you don\u2019t challenge the tsar.\nBut the popular assumption that Prigozhin would swiftly be eliminated \u2013 which shifted to surprise when he wasn\u2019t \u2013 tells us much about the current weakness and fragility that surrounds Russian politics.\nIn fact, Prigozhin\u2019s apparent elimination is likely to exacerbate that weakness rather than lead to a magical reassertion of Putin\u2019s authority .\nFirst, it shows Russian elites they can\u2019t trust anything their president says. That\u2019s a significant departure from the Kremlin\u2019s previous modus operandi, whereby those in positions of power and influence were protected by Putin. They could count on him as long as they played by his rules.\nREAD MORE The mysterious deaths of Vladimir Putin\u2019s enemies and critics\nAlthough Prigozhin eventually departed from that, he went out of his way for many years \u2013 even after his mutiny \u2013 to demonstrate his loyalty to Putin.\nFollowing the Wagner revolt, it seemed perplexing for Putin to give Prigozhin and his Wagner co-conspirators a public assurance they would be safe from retribution.\nNow, Prigozhin\u2019s subsequent likely death \u2013 the crash was reported by Wagner\u2019s Telegram channel as having been caused by a Russian air defence missile \u2013 means it matters very little whether it was an accident: nobody will believe this was anything other than revenge.\nWhile that may initially give the more ambitious members of the Kremlin clans some pause, they now have real incentives to seek out an alternative.\nPut simply, Putin\u2019s politics of terror has a self-destructive flaw: ruling through fear and deception inevitably prompts those who might be targets (which is essentially anyone) to eventually try to change the rules of the game.\nSecond, Prigozhin\u2019s death won\u2019t spell the end for private military companies (PMCs) in Russia. On the contrary, they\u2019re likely to continue to proliferate. Already the energy giant Gazprom has several of them, with operators in Ukraine as well as Russia.\nThere is also speculation the fast-expanding Redut group may now try to step in to fill the Wagner void.\nREAD MORE What were Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries doing in Africa?\nBut this has a bearing on Russian domestic politics too: PMCs are likely to be used by influential figures as private armies for their own protection from the Russian state, just as much as they might be employed as proxies in its service.\nThat, in turn, raises the spectre of a society of warlords \u2013 not just confined to strongmen on Russia\u2019s periphery, such as the Kadyrovites who are loyal to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov \u2013 but in other parts of Russia closer to the centres of power in Moscow and St Petersburg. Under those circumstances, the prospects for stability in Russia are grim.\nIronically, perhaps the least significant impact of Prigozhin\u2019s death will be on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Wagner forces had been withdrawn from combat a couple of months previously. They have not been redeployed to the front since Prigozhin\u2019s revolt.\nWagner troops have been offered the choice of joining other Russian PMCs or signing contracts with the Russian armed forces: the former remains the preferred option given the regular Russian military is poorly paid in comparison. There will also be those who choose neither option, leaving the problem of significant numbers of Russian men trained for violence at large in its society.\nAs for the future of the organisation itself, Wagner is at a crossroads. In addition to Prigozhin, two other victims in the crash were Wagner\u2019s alleged co-founder Dmitry Utkin, who was responsible for its combat operations, and its head of security Valery Chekalov.\nThe crash has therefore not only killed a Putin rival but also permanently erased Wagner\u2019s senior command structure.\nYet Wagner remains important for the promotion of the Kremlin\u2019s interests in damaging US and European influence in Africa.\nBeyond its active role in Syria, it has been instrumental in boosting Russian prestige by propping up regional dictators in Mali and the Central African Republic, which have rewarded Wagner with lucrative natural resource contracts.\nIt may continue in an abridged form under new management, or be subsumed into another proxy Russian force.\nREAD MORE There are fears Russia's Wagner mercenaries are taking advantage of instability in Niger\nA final important puzzle concerns why the Kremlin waited so long to rid itself of Prigozhin. We can only speculate here, but one theory is the intelligence services needed time to discover how deeply the pro-Wagner rot had extended into the armed forces and other power structures.\nIt is striking that Sergei Surovikin (the former commander of Russian forces in Ukraine who had disappeared under suspicion of being a Wagner sympathiser) was formally removed from his post as Russia\u2019s Air Force chief at almost the exact same time as Prigozhin\u2019s plane went down.\nPrigozhin\u2019s career trajectory saw him rise from a convicted felon to presidential caterer, then Russia\u2019s main disinformation peddler, and eventually the wealthy and brutal head of a semi-private military company that sought to outcompete Russia\u2019s own Defence Ministry for influence.", "Matches": "34,17,14,2", "Num matches": 4}, {"publication": "SMH", "scraped_datetime": "08AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Putin\u2019s enemies don\u2019t die of natural causes, but good riddance to the monster Prigozhin", "Url": "https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/putin-s-enemies-don-t-die-of-natural-causes-but-good-riddance-to-the-monster-prigozhin-20230824-p5dz2h.html", "Rank": 8, "Text": "One of the most predictable elements of war is surprise. Since the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year, there have been myriad surprises. From Russia\u2019s defeat in its Kyiv campaign, the Ukrainian Kharkiv offensive, and attacks on the Kerch Bridge and Moscow, surprise has been a constant in this conflict.\nPerhaps one of the most profound surprises, at least for Russian politics, was the Prigozhin mutiny of June this year. Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private military company the Wagner Group, led a short but high-profile insurrection that saw his troops advance to within 300 kilometres of Moscow. The main casualties of the day were from the Russian Air Force, which lost multiple helicopters and other aircraft. More than 30 airmen were killed.\nThis is tragic, yet all the more ironic given events of the past hours. Travelling in his private jet, Prigozhin was shot down over Russia. All aboard the aircraft, including Prigozhin and the Wagner chief of operations Dmitry Uktin, were killed.\nThe crash has set off another round of guessing among pundits and Russia experts about who is to blame and what might be the impacts of Prigozhin\u2019s spectacular death. But ultimately, the cause of the crash is irrelevant. Most will assume Putin is to blame, and he has most to gain from the death of Prigozhin and his most senior confederates.

The Washington Post interviewed a Georgia bail bondsman at a company called Red Eye Bail Bonds (who asked to stay anonymous, citing privacy concerns and the headaches that can come with weighing in on American politics). While the bond was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he deals with, the bondsman said Trump\u2019s case isn\u2019t as unusual as it may appear, at least from the perspective of a bondsman: In general, the manager said, Red Eye requires that a client provide 10 percent of the total bond. If the person under arrest is deemed to be a higher risk, that percentage increases. If the risk is higher, the company also will do more on the front end to establish whether resources exist to recoup the full value of the bond. Does the client own a house? Things like this. After all, while Red Eye requires only 10 percent, the county requires the whole thing. That doesn\u2019t mean that the firm has to put up $200,000 in cash. The whole point of involving a bondsman, after all, is that the firm serves as a proxy of trust on behalf of clients. There is a specialized power of attorney that is granted the firm, and when Red Eye decides to act as a guarantor for a client, a sum reflecting the total bond is frozen with the firm\u2019s insurer. I asked whether Trump\u2019s $200,000 was unusually high. The manager thought about it for a moment before determining that it was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he usually sees. The midrange is about $100,000 or $110,000, he told me, but in cases involving more serious charges, costs could run higher. He was also not fazed by the unique circumstances of Trump\u2019s situation. He often has clients who are facing more than one indictment; that shows up in the initial analysis of the case and factors into the consideration of the arrestee as a flight risk. It is also not unusual for one party to live out of state, as Trump does. (He used the example of a college kid getting arrested and his parents posting bond remotely.) This, too, would on other occasions give him pause. But he wasn\u2019t really worried about Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019s just outright not going to show up in court,\u201d he said. This wasn\u2019t just about Trump; in other \u201chigh-end cases like that, most likely or not the families are not going anywhere.\u201d (I didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s recent social media post about moving to Russia.)\nUpdated at 12.29 AEST\n1h ago 12.07 AEST Citing two sources, CNN has more details on why Donald Trump opted to pose the way he did in his mug shot: Trump's team had discussed the former president's mug shot prior to him taking it at the Fulton County jail Thursday evening, two sources familiar with the discussions tell me.

That all changed about a year-and-a-half later when, after a tortuous process that nearly went to court, billionaire Elon Musk bought the influential social media platform. Musk, who recently renamed the platform X, was already a prolific tweeter and after buying the site held a poll asking whether Trump should be let back on.

The former president turns his eyes up to glare toward the camera above him. Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-accused in their booking photos. Instead, his mouth is taut and downturned. The picture does not flatter, but it does convey the message many of Trump\u2019s supporters want to hear \u2013 one of belligerence. The six-pointed star of the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office badge and the name of the sheriff, Patrick Labat, sits in the top left-hand corner of the picture. But some will be disappointed that Trump is not seen in the classic pose holding a board in front of his chest with his name and date of arrest. For all that, the former president\u2019s supporters are already embracing the booking photo as a badge of honour and defiance. It will be held up as evidence that their man will not give up the fight against a system his followers see as ever more determined to bring him down and prevent him returning to the White House. The mugshot\u2019s rapid appearance on T-shirts, posters and, well, mugs glorifying a martyred Trump can be expected. The president\u2019s detractors, on the other hand, will see the booking photo as evidence that even a man who was once the most powerful person in the land cannot escape the might of the justice system. Some will welcome anything that makes him look even a little bit more criminal as a confirmation that sooner or later he is going to prison. The accused may be innocent until a plea or a jury says otherwise, but mugshots can have a way of conveying guilt. Trump\u2019s mugshot released by Fulton county officials.

Wagner Group, is believed to have died in a plane crash.\nPrigozhin led an armed rebellion against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, which Putin described as treason.\nMany of Putin's enemies have died in mysterious circumstances over the years.\nRussian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is believed to have been killed in a plane crash north of Moscow on Wednesday evening.\nHe has not been confirmed dead but was on the plane's passenger list, and Russian authorities said there were no survivors.\nPrigozhin was formerly an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin but became an enemy after launching an armed mutiny against the president in late June.\nHe's not the first of Putin's enemies to suffer a mysterious death or near-death experience.\nWhat happened to Yevgeny Prigozhin?\nPrigozhin was once a close associate of Putin, but became an enemy after leading what Russian officials described as an \"armed mutiny\" in June.\nIn 2014, he founded Wagner Group, a paramilitary organisation that has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Mali, among other countries.\nThe mercenaries were supporting the Kremlin in the war in Ukraine, until Prigozhin called for an armed rebellion and pledged to oust Russia's military leadership.\nThe mutiny was ended by an apparent Kremlin deal which saw Prigozhin agree to relocate to neighbouring Belarus.\nPrigozhin posted a video address on Monday which he suggested was filmed in Africa.\nUnconfirmed Russian media reports said that Prigozhin and his associates had attended a meeting on Wednesday with officials from the Russian Defence Ministry.\nOnline flight tracker Flightradar24 showed that the Embraer plane (registration number RA-02795) carrying Prigozhin had dropped off the

what Western experts concluded was the military nerve agent Novichok .\nRussia has denied any involvement.\nNavalny voluntarily returned to Russia in 2021 and was immediately arrested on arrival.\nIn early August, Navalny had an extra 19 years in a maximum security penal colony added to his jail term.\nHe was already serving sentences totalling 11-and-a-half years on fraud and other charges that

While there is evidence that Parkinson\u2019s could also begin in the gut, there have been few studies of its relationship to particular digestive disorders.\nNow a study has established that four gut conditions could be an early warning sign of Parkinson\u2019s disease. It \u201cis the first to establish substantial observational evidence\u201d that a clinical diagnosis of gut issues \u201cmight specifically predict the development of Parkinson\u2019s disease\u201d, the authors conclude.\nResearchers compared the medical records of 24,624 people in the US with Parkinson\u2019s, 19,046 people with Alzheimer\u2019s and 23,942 people with cerebrovascular disease.\nThose with Parkinson\u2019s were matched with patients in the other groups for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and length of diagnosis to compare the frequency of gastrointestinal conditions in the six years before diagnosis.\nThey also compared the medical records of everyone in the study diagnosed with any of 18 gut conditions to those without that particular condition over five years to see how many of them developed Parkinson\u2019s disease or other neurological disorders.\nBoth comparisons found a higher risk of a Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis for patients with gut issues. Those with constipation, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and gastroparesis, where food takes longer to move from the stomach into the small intestine, were more than twice as likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s disease in the five years before diagnosis, while IBS without diarrhoea was associated with a 17% higher risk.\nSome gastrointestinal symptoms, including functional dyspepsia (burning sensation or fullness of the stomach with no obvious cause), IBS with diarrhoea, and diarrhoea plus faecal incontinence, were found to be more common among patients who developed Parkinson\u2019s disease too. But they were also more common before the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, aneurysms or strokes.\nHowever, other gut issues such as inflammatory bowel disease did not increase the likelihood of developing Parkinson\u2019s, the study found.\nAnd patients who had their appendix removed were less likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s, the authors calculated.\nThey added that the findings \u201cwarrant alertness\u201d for gut issues in those patients at higher risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease and call for further investigation of the links between gastrointestinal conditions and Alzheimer\u2019s, strokes and aneurysms.\nParkinson\u2019s UK estimates that there will be about 172,00 people in the UK with the disease by 2030.

But targeting key risk factors, several of which involve lifestyle, could avert about 40% of cases.\nA new dementia risk score, drawing on 11 mostly modifiable risk factors, can identify people at risk \u2013 from mid-life onwards \u2013 of developing the disease within the next 14 years. The findings were published in the open access journal BMJ Mental Health.\nThe research, led by the University of Oxford, examined data on people aged 50 to 73 taking part in two large long-term British studies \u2013 the UK Biobank study and the Whitehall II study.\nIn the UK Biobank study, 220,762 people with an average age of 60 were examined to develop the risk-assessment tool, and 2,934 people with an average age of 57 from the Whitehall II study helped to validate it.\nResearchers compiled a list of 28 known factors linked to dementia risk and then identified the strongest predictors. This produced a list of 11 predictive factors, which were then used to develop the UK Biobank Dementia Risk Score (UKBDRS) tool.\nThe 11 factors are age, education, a history of diabetes, a history of depression, a history of stroke, parental history of dementia, levels of deprivation, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, living alone and being male.\nResearchers also examined these risk factors alongside whether or not people carried a specific gene \u2013 the APOE gene, which is a known risk factor for dementia. This risk tool was called the UKBDRS-APOE tool.\nThey found that UKBDRS-APOE produced the highest predictive score, closely followed by the UKBDRS risk tool. The researchers said that the tool \u201csignificantly outperforms\u201d similar other risk assessments currently available.\nAs well as identifying those at risk, these tools can also highlight preventive measures people can take while it is still possible.\nThe academics point to previous work that suggests up to 40% of dementia cases could be prevented through modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as stopping smoking, reducing high blood pressure, losing weight and reducing alcohol intake.\nThe new tool could be used as an initial screening tool for dementia to put people in \u201crisk groups\u201d, they said.\nThose who come back with a high probability of developing dementia, according to the risk score, could be prioritised for further tests including cognitive assessments, brain scans and blood tests.\n\u201cThe UKBDRS may best be used as an initial screening tool to stratify people into risk groups, and those identified as high risk could then benefit from the more time-intensive follow-up assessments described above for more detailed characterisation,\u201d said the lead author, Dr Raihaan Patel, from the University of Oxford.\nAssociate professor Sana Suri from the University of Oxford, a co-lead author, added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that this risk score only tells us about our chances of developing dementia; it doesn\u2019t represent a definitive outcome.\n\u201cThe importance of each risk factor varies and given that some of the factors included in the score can be modified or treated, there are things we can all do to help reduce our risk of dementia.\n\u201cWhile older age (60 and above) and APOE confer the greatest risk, modifiable factors, such as diabetes, depression, and high blood pressure also have a key role. For example, the estimated risk for a person with all of these will be approximately three times higher than that of a person of the same age who doesn\u2019t have any.\u201d", "Matches": "8", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "The Guardian", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "LiveNews live: Australia backs Japan on release of treated Fukushima water", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/25/australia-news-rental-crisis-cost-of-living-wages-jim-chalmers-intergenerational-reporrt-tax-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-to-parliament", "Rank": 2, "Text": "From 2h ago 11.08 AEST Australia backs Japan on release of treated Fukushima water Daniel Hurst The Australian government has backed the release of treated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, while calling for continued reassurance to be provided to countries across the region.

Fukushima fishing communities and Pacific island countries have also expressed unease.

The AEC said it \u201ccompletely and utterly rejects\u201d the notion it is undermining the impartiality and fairness of the referendum. The ballot paper will provide formal voting instructions, asking Australia to clearly write either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d but the AEC has said legal advice says a clear tick will be counted while a cross will not. Less than 1% of votes lodged in the 1999 referendum on becoming a republic were deemed informal. The AEC\u2019s statement said: There has been intense commentary online and in mainstream media regarding what will and will not be a formal vote for the 2023 referendum; specifically around whether or not a \u2018tick\u2019 or a \u2018cross\u2019 will be able to be counted. Much of that commentary is factually incorrect and ignores: the law surrounding \u2018savings provisions\u2019, the longstanding legal advice regarding the use of ticks and crosses, and the decades-long and multi-referendum history of the application of that law and advice. This morning Coalition figures, including the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and his deputy, Sussan Ley, queried why the decision appeared one-sided. Ley told Seven\u2019s Sunrise: So, quite simply, what would people think? A tick is yes, a cross is no.

As Guardian Australia revealed on Thursday, the ship has been denied permission to pass under the bridge to access a refuelling station just on the other side. It must now travel hundreds of kilometres to another port on the other side of the state, costing more money and generating more emissions. Tasmania\u2019s harbour master, Mick Wall, told ABC Hobart the RSV Nuyina had the largest \u201cwindage area\u201d of any vessel that had applied for permission to pass underneath the bridge. He said while the rules had not changed, Nuyina\u2019s dimensions had: \u201cIt [is] outside the minimum limits for safe transit at the bridge. The initial design width was about 25.6m when it was delivered. It\u2019s now currently at 35.1m. So it\u2019s a significant increase in the beam. And obviously, as you\u2019d understand, putting a moving vessel through the concrete upright on the main navigation span of the Tasman bridge is not something which you don\u2019t just attempt and have a crack at and see how you go. Tasmania\u2019s port authority takes safety extremely seriously given a tragedy in 1975, when 12 people died after a cargo ship crashed into the bridge, causing part of the structure to collapse. Wall also told the ABC the Nuyina can safely pass underneath the bridge from the southern side, but cannot safely travel back. That is due to the ship needing to complete a turn before passing through the concrete beams on one side. Given the size of the ship and its surface area, there is little room for error. Here\u2019s how Wall put it: The risk is always a loss of control ... The vessel has a significant amount of drift and side slip. The vessel is perfectly suited for straight line work, perfectly suited for ice operations. It is a very powerful ship. But when you put that vessel into a dynamic turn, it slides.\nUpdated at 12.54 AEST\n46m ago 12.29 AEST Auditor general finds cybersecurity being poorly managed A report says the federal government is continuing to poorly manage its cybersecurity, AAP reports.

Fifty-three of 144 departments and agencies assessed had no policy for user access removal or defining the timeframe in which access should be removed following a user leaving. A total of 119 agencies did not have an effective control or activity to monitor access or activity in their systems after user cessation. But when the auditor asked agencies to self-assess, 80% said they were \u201cfully effective\u201d in handling the issue.\nUpdated at 12.52 AEST\n1h ago 12.07 AEST Experts investigate type of shark in Port Macquarie attack Surf Life Saving NSW have put out a statement on the man bitten by a shark in Port Macquarie.

The Japanese government yesterday began the first phase of water releases into the Pacific Ocean, prompting China to ban all seafood imports from Japan. Fukushima fishing communities and Pacific island countries have also expressed unease. While on-site technology is being used to remove most harmful substances, it is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nuclear power plant operator Tepco said the first batch of discharged water would contain about 190 becquerels of tritium per litre \u2013 well below the World Health Organization drinking water limit of 10,000 becquerels per litre. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement: Australia, like other countries in our region, is committed to the ongoing protection of the Blue Pacific. We welcome Japan\u2019s transparency and international engagement including with Pacific island countries and expect this to continue. Australia has confidence in the process that has led to the decision by Japan to release the treated water. Dfat said Australia supported the \u201ccritical role\u201d of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Japan\u2019s plans for managing the release, noting its findings in early July that the release would be consistent with internationally accepted safety standards that ensure the protection of people and the environment: Australia has full confidence in the IAEA\u2019s independent, impartial, and science-based technical advice. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency issued advice on 11 July 2023 supporting the IAEA\u2019s assessment that the proposed discharge will not adversely impact people or the environment. Australia welcomes the IAEA\u2019s commitment to provide ongoing monitoring and periodic review during the discharge, including maintaining an on-site presence at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. This will provide reassurance to the region.\nUpdated at 11.22 AEST\n2h ago 10.54 AEST Benita Kolovos Victoria police have confirmed they are investigating the incident that saw Ringwood MP, Will Fowles, dumped from the Labor party. In a statement on Friday morning, police said: Detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad are investigating following a report of an incident in the Melbourne CBD. Police were initially notified of the matter by the state government and a formal investigation has now commenced. Given the sensitive nature of this incident and now that it is subject to active investigation, we will not be providing any further commentary on the matter.\u201d Police said unless there is an outcome or significant update, they will not be providing media with further information. Earlier this month, the premier, Daniel Andrews, said it was no longer acceptable for the Ringwood MP to remain in the parliamentary party after his office referred Fowles to the police over the alleged assault. In a statement posted on Facebook, Fowles said the allegation of assault was \u201cnot true.\u201d \u201cI was shocked and distressed to learn last night that an allegation of assault has been made against me,\u201d he said. Fowles said the details of the allegation, which he denies, had not been put to him by the premier\u2019s office. It is not true. There was no assault. He said he expected his resignation from the parliamentary Labor party would be temporary and vowed to cooperate with any process of enquiries.\n3h ago 10.38 AEST Varroa mites prompt emergency beehive biosecurity order in NSW\u2019s Riverina and Sunraysia regions Varroa mites have been found in NSW\u2019s Riverina and Sunraysia regions, posing a threat to the almond industry and prompting an emergency biosecurity order barring the movement of beehives, AAP reports. The NSW Department of Primary Industries detected the bee parasite in hives at Euroley in the Riverina and Euston in Sunraysia. A 10km eradication zone and a 25km surveillance zone is in place \u2013 hives cannot be moved into, within or out of those areas. DPI\u2019s chief plant protection officer, Shane Hetherington, said before the detection many beekeepers had moved hives for both almond and canola pollination. The new detection at Euston has clear links to an infested premises in the Kempsey area, which we\u2019ve been able to track through the movement declaration process. We are continuing investigations into the link for the Euroley hives, although they have also travelled from the Kempsey region. Tracing and testing hives moved from the Kempsey region remains NSW DPI top priority, to ensure we can get in front of any further spread. The new detections bring the total number of infested premises in NSW to 215. Crop Pollination of Australia\u2019s president, Steve Fuller, said the outbreaks could have a big impact on the industry. This is our greatest fear. You\u2019re looking at tens of thousands of hives in those areas doing [the] almond population at the moment.\nUpdated at 10.47 AEST\n3h ago 10.18 AEST Chalmers says Qantas will not need to pay back money received during Covid after posting massive profits The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has quashed suggestions that Qantas should pay back money it received from the government after the airline posted record profits, AAP reports. Yesterday, Qantas reported an underlying profit of $2.47bn for the past financial year \u2013 a big jump compared to an almost $2bn loss the year before. In the wake of the results, pressure is growing for them to pay back some of the money received from the government at the height of the Covid-19 crisis ($2.7bn from taxpayers during the pandemic, including $900m from the jobkeeper program). But Chalmers said the profits from Qantas showed the tourism industry was making a strong recovery post-Covid. He told ABC Radio this morning: When those funds were provided by the previous government, there wasn\u2019t an understanding or an agreement that they would be repaid in some form. What [the profits] reflect is the fact the Australian tourism industry is making a big contribution to our economy and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a big employer in our economy.\nUpdated at 10.29 AEST\n4h ago 09.41 AEST Phoebe McIlwraith Send us your questions on the Indigenous voice to parliament An upcoming episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s The Voice Ask Me Anything podcast series will feature prominent Indigenous yes and no campaigners.

Under the changes, children can be held in watch houses with no human rights law recourse. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said amendments to the youth justice laws were difficult but ultimately essential to ensure community safety. He told ABC Radio: In this case, we had a court finding that said that young people could no longer be held in watch houses. We were advised by the solicitor general that if we didn\u2019t make these changes immediately, the young people in watch houses would need to be released to the community. They were in watch houses because police believe they\u2019re a danger to the community. We were faced with a very difficult situation \u2013 legal advice that said the only way we could keep the community safe was if we immediately addressed the technicality the court had found.

An ageing population\nAustralians are living longer and they're having fewer children.\nSo, even with net migration accounted for, the government is predicting slower population growth and lower workforce participation due to ageing.\nAs this chart projects, people aged 65 and over will more than double by 2063:\nWhat does this mean? With older Australians spending more years in good health, it's predicted there'll be rising demand for government-funded services like aged and disability care. And with fewer children, it's predicted the size of the workforce relative to the dependent population will fall.\n2. A higher skilled workforce\nThe ongoing digital and technological transformation is expected to continue to raise incomes and quality of life.\nIt's also expected to increase the demand for specialised skills and to change the nature of work.\nIn particular, employment is anticipated to grow in the services industries, which include health care and social assistance, education and training services, as well as professional, scientific and technical services.\nThis projected trend is reflected in the rising share of jobs that currently require a bachelor's degree or above, from 20 per cent in 1966 to 34 per cent in 2021:\nAt the same time, this chart shows the share of jobs requiring high levels of cognitive skills has increased by 17 per cent:\nWhat does this mean? It's predicted the labour market will continue to demand skills that are complementary to existing and new technologies. Meanwhile, the automation of routine tasks will result in a greater focus on foundational skills, such as communication, problem solving and team work.\n3. Hotter temperatures\nThe government anticipates hotter temperatures, basing its projections on data from the Bureau of Meteorology:\nUnder a scenario where global temperatures increase by up to 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, Australia's national average temperature is projected to increase by 1.7C.\nAs seen in the maps below, some parts of Australia will be more exposed than others depending on how high temperatures rise.\nThe map on the left shows temperature projections for a climate scenario under a 2C warming path, while the one on the right shows the possible impact of a 3C increase:\nSupplied: Intergenerational Report 2023\nWhat does this mean? Besides health and environmental impacts, higher temperatures are predicted to impact labour productivity, with workers in exposed industries having to reduce their time in the heat or the physical intensity of their work. Weather changes are also projected to result in lower crop yields and higher government spending on natural disaster recovery and resilience efforts.\n4. Slower labour productivity\nWith all of these changes considered, the government has revised down its long-term productivity projections.\nIt moved from a 30-year productivity growth average of 1.5 per cent per year to a 20-year average of 1.2 per cent:", "Matches": "4", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "SMH", "scraped_datetime": "08AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Restaurant quality or flop?

Got it Share\nFrom the lasagne-filled ravioli made by Latina Fresh, to eggplant parmigiana tortellini from Rana, the fresh pasta in the refrigerated section of your local supermarket has evolved and expanded. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a change driven by increasing interest in supermarket meals, as consumers swap restaurant dishes for ready-made convenience during the cost of living crisis. Data from an NAB consumer report released in July showed that 55 per cent of 2000 consumers surveyed were willing to cut down on eating out or buying takeaway meals as a way of balancing their budgets. Ready-made meals offer an attractive alternative, with fresh pasta ready to eat in under five minutes for as little as $2.50 per serve. Quarantine pasta sauce with tuna and olives by Katrina Meynink. Katrina Meynink Quarantine sauce: Turn one tomato sauce into 10 dinners \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the last year, we have seen a growth in fresh pasta sales as customers look for more gourmet options at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesperson for Woolworths tells Good Food.\nAdvertisement\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know many customers are looking for more ways to get value out of their shop and with our fresh pasta range, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing restaurant quality to the kitchen table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both major supermarkets now offer more than 20 varieties of fresh pasta, and Coles has recently introduced several home-brand options targeted at vegans (Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kitchen) and athletes (Perform Build). Across Australia, revenue in the pasta market is expected to grow by 3.65 per cent over the next year. With all of these new choices, it can be difficult to tell how the pasta will cook and eat from a quick glance at the options in the refrigerator aisle. So I decided to put them to the test. Choosing both filled ricotta and cheese pasta and simple strands of fresh supermarket pasta from Coles and Woolworths (along with a few wild cards), I considered the following factors when determining my ranking:\nAdvertisement\nColour (and where the colour comes from)\nLength\nCooking time\nTexture\nFlavour\nValue For this taste test, I used Katrina Meynink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarantine sauce. One pot makes about 10 dinners and includes two cups of white wine (leaving you two glasses to sip while the sauce simmers). Be aware, the sauce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four-hour cooking time means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to get cracking in the afternoon if you want to eat dinner at a reasonable time. Each pasta was cooked according its package instructions, with a big pinch of sea salt in plenty of boiling water. Salt enhances the flavour of the pasta, making it an important step for any pasta you choose to cook. It was then drained and tested both before and after adding the sauce. Fresh supermarket filled spinach and ricotta pasta (ranked from worst to best) Coles spinach and ricotta agnolotti.\nAdvertisement\nColes spinach and ricotta agnolotti, $5 for 600g\nServes four, ready in three minutes The mildly flavoured spinach and ricotta filling was thick and pasty in this budget Coles option, frequently sticking to the roof of my mouth (bleurgh). There were also quite a few empty pasta pockets. But you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat it for price, coming in at just $1.25 a serve. 25degrees South baby spinach and fetta ravioli. 25degrees South baby spinach and Victoria fetta ravioli, $9 for 325g\nServes two, ready in three minutes 25degrees South is channelling farm-to-table restaurant vibes with the packaging, but the ravioli isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite there. In a pot of boiling water the big, delicate pillows of pasta fall apart quickly, letting the filling escape. What remains is flavoursome but water-logged, and difficult to eat.\nAdvertisement\nLeggo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fresh ricotta and spinach agnolotti. Leggo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ricotta and spinach agnolotti with parmesan, $9 for 630g\nServes four, ready in five minutes This is a good option for families at $2.25 a serve. The filling is a pale green paste with a barely perceptible flavour of parmesan. Still, it emerges al dente after five minutes and gets the job done. Grand Italian ricotta and spinach agnolotti. Grand Italian ricotta and spinach agnolotti, $6 for 325g\nServes two, ready in four minutes\nAdvertisement\nCreamy mascarpone and aged grana padano cheese are added to the classic ricotta and spinach pairing for \u00e2\u0080\u009cextra flavour\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m struggling to taste it. This is a relatively bland option with thick pasta, best suited for when you want the flavours of your pasta sauce to really shine. Latina Fresh ricotta and spinach agnolotti, $8.50 for 625g\nServes four, ready in five minutes The packaging promises this is a new recipe, with more filling and thinner pasta. The smooth mixture of Australian-made ricotta, parmesan and spinach has a subtle but notably cheesy flavour. The pasta still errs on the thicker side, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty nice with a generous serving of quarantine sauce. WINNER\nRana ricotta and spinach tortellini, $8 for 325g\nServes two, ready in two minutes Italian favourite Rana has nailed this one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a simple, creamy filling with a comparatively greater percentage of ricotta and spinach, encased in thin sheets of fresh pasta. Each mouthful is a satisfying pop of flavour, sweet and a little citrusy.\nAdvertisement\nWildcards: Are they worth it? Latina Fresh vegetarian broccoli and potato, $8 for 375g\nServes two, ready in two minutes Does anyone else have a core childhood memory of eating sad, wet broccoli after your mum boiled it for too long? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this green filling reminds me of. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely off-putting, but it certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my favourite either (especially for the price). Coles Perform Build high-protein vegetable ravioli. Coles Perform Build high protein vegetable ravioli, $6 for 360g\nServes two, ready in three minutes\nAdvertisement\nDoes it taste like anything? No (at least, not that I can tell). Does it make me feel better to know that one serve contains roughly half of my daily protein intake? Yes. For gym-goers who are tired of meal-prepping the same high-protein dinners day in, day out, it could offer an inoffensive and quick alternative. Coles Angus beef ravioli. Coles Finest free-range egg ravioli with Angus beef ragu and grana padano, $6 for 350g\nServes two, ready in 1.5 minutes Giovanni Di Sebastiano and his family have made pasta in Melbourne for more than 30 years, so I had high hopes for this Coles collaboration. The pasta itself is great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 big pillows of delicate pasta, cooked al dente. And the filling is generous, coming right out to the edges, all rich and meaty. But there is something about the sinewy texture that just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for me. 25degrees South three cheese ravioli.\nAdvertisement\n25degrees South Victorian three cheese ravioli, $9 for 325g\nServes two, ready in three minutes These large, soft pillows of pasta pack a real punch. With a generous filling of Gippsland milk ricotta, mascarpone and pecorino wrapped in silky cracked pepper pasta, this is a flavourful option reminiscent of cacio e pepe. After three minutes the pasta is al dente and best paired with a simple buttery sauce. WINNER\nRana eggplant parmigiana tortellini, $5 for 325g\nServes two, ready in two minutes What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to love about this tortellini? It ticks all the boxes: a creamy filling; a soft and quick-cooking pasta that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall apart; and a subtle, cheesy, tomatoey flavour that would complement many types of sauce. If I ever feel like eating filled pasta from the supermarket again (doubtful), this is the one I will buy. Fresh non-filled supermarket pasta (ranked from worst to best)\nAdvertisement\nWhat makes a good fresh non-filled supermarket pasta? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re softer and more supple than their dried pastas and better suited to smooth, saucy dishes. But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also easy to overcook, prone to tearing and considerably more expensive than the dry stuff. Latina Fresh gluten-free tagliatelle, $8.75 for 280g\nServes two, ready in two minutes The first thing I noticed about this pasta was how sticky it was once cooked. That makes it great for picking up sauce, but the rubbery mouthfeel wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for me. It was also very yellow, likely due to the addition of carotene in an attempt to better mimic the look of wheat-based egg pasta. Add on that price tag ($4.37 per serve) and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving this one to the coeliacs. Coles fresh pappardelle. Coles pasta pappardelle, $4.20 for 300g\nServes two, ready in three minutes\nAdvertisement\nA good pappardelle pasta should be long and thick, with a slightly rougher texture to really pick up all that delicious sauce. This one missed the mark, with super short, dense strands of pasta that stuck together in boiling water and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adhere well to the sauce. iPastai fresh pappardelle. iPastai pappardelle, $5 for 350g\nServes three, ready in two minutes The sunshine yellow strands of thick pappardelle pasta looked great in the cardboard gingham packaging, but struggled to separate in boiling water. They emerged, despite my best efforts, still clinging together. This is a heavy and doughy pasta that retains its structure under repeated fork stabbings and the weight of a heartier sauce. Plus, at just $1.60 per serve, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good value.\nAdvertisement\nLatina Fresh classic egg fettuccine, $6 for 375g\nServes two, ready in two minutes This pasta looks fresh and light coming out of the packaging, and holds its shape well when cooked. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shorter and flimsier than its rival Rana (below), becoming soggy and brittle under the weight of the sauce. When considering that higher price tag ($3 per serve), I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to pass. Coles fresh fettuccine. Coles fettuccine, $4.20 for 300g\nServes two, ready in three minutes Coles fettuccine keeps things simple, using just three Australian ingredients in its recipe. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flat, thin, pale and short \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certainly not one for those who like twirling their pasta. But in three minutes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooked perfectly al dente and gets the job done for just $2.10 per serve.\nAdvertisement\nRana fettuccine, $6 for 325g\nServes two, ready in two minutes Rana delivers a light fettuccine that feels pretty close to restaurant-quality, maybe because of its egg content, which is higher than some. But does it \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake any sauce sing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as promised on the packaging? Well, it does capture the sauce. But it also becomes flimsy under the extra weight, breaking apart when twirled with a fork. It is also the most exxy of the bunch, at $3 per serve. iPastai fresh linguine.

She thought maybe if Moon missed, she would have her on countback, but the official said no, there would be a jump-off, or they could agree to split it. Kennedy was in no doubt: if she could stop jumping she would, well, jump at the chance.

She is an Olympic gold medallist, I thought she might have said, \u2018Let\u2019s keep jumping\u2019. But when I floated the idea, she was like, \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018Are you sure you want to do this? Yes? OK\u2019, so we did it ... I was like: \u2018Girl, are you sure?

A gold medal shared is still a gold medal, after all, and Moon was just as happy as Kennedy to share the title. \u201cWhen the final started, I didn\u2019t think about how sharing a gold medal would work for me, but now I am completely satisfied. What a battle it was, oh my ...\u201d reigning champion Moon said.\nBritain\u2019s 2012 Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said on the BBC coverage she loved the rule change that allowed competitors to split medals. \u201cI am a big softie, it is so beautiful, it really displays what our sport is about,\u201d Ennis-Hill said. \u201c[We\u2019ve seen] two epic performances, and they\u2019ve both come away with that gold medal.\u201d Having entrenched herself as Australia\u2019s greatest women\u2019s pole vaulter, Kennedy can now realistically aim to break five metres and win gold in Paris at next year\u2019s Olympic Games, her coach Paul Burgess said.\n\u201cI just think she is one of the great all-time clutch performers. She amazes me. Just because it was Nina, and she was performing good even though she hadn\u2019t done a really big one, I knew she was saving it for the world champs. She just knows how to turn it on,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, [five metres] is something she wants ... and she is capable of five metres. That\u2019s one of her main goals, among a bunch of other things. It\u2019s really hard to do, but I now think that nothing is beyond her. She\u2019s a champion. \u201cWe are aiming to win Paris. You just don\u2019t know how often these moments come, but we\u2019re not going to aim for less than this. We are more than happy to aim big, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s delusional. These are our goals. \u201cTo aim for anything less would be cheating ourselves.\u201d\nLoading Between her jumps, Kennedy was a tortured figure, unsure what to do with herself. Before Moon\u2019s second last jump, she sat on the track with her back to the runway. She would sneak the occasional peek at the big screen, but didn\u2019t have to watch Moon jump to know what had happened \u2013 the crowd would tell her each time how high Moon had risen. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard because if she clears, you have to jump again, so it is this weird balance of watching, but [knowing] I need to focus on myself,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to look like a bitch; you have to clap, you have to watch, but it is this weird thing \u2013 you are also trying to fix the technical things with the coach.

Now, it's one of the highest-grossing movies released in the US this year.\nJim Caviezel (who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ), stars as Tim Ballard, the real-life Homeland Security Agent who creates a charity to combat child traffickers.\nBut for many reasons, separate from the heavy subject matter at the focus of the film, the movie is leaving people uncomfortable.\nAnd now it's available across cinemas in Australia - with Dendy cinemas (co-owned by Mel Gibson) also screening the movie, citing \u201coverwhelming demand\u201d. In a tweet promoting the movie, the film's distributors said, \"Break the Silence. Save The Children,\" a popular phrase coined by QAnon.\nThe first controversy: The QAnon support\nThe movie was shot in 2018, at a time when the American conspiracy theory movement, QAnon, was starting to gain traction.\nAnd its script was written in 2015, well before the movement's emergence in 2017, its writer and director Alejandro Monteverde told entertainment news publication Variety.\nWhile the film, made by Angel Studios, tells a non-partisan story and doesn't reference QAnon, believers of the conspiracy theory have latched onto the film, promoting it for their own agenda.\nQAnon followers believe that left-leaning elites in government, Hollywood stars and billionaires run a paedophile and human trafficking ring. They also believe that these people are harvesting an adrenaline-like substance from children to attain eternal life. Former US President Donald Trump is also thought by followers to be waging a secret battle against this \u201cdeep state\u201d scheme.\nIt hasn't helped that lead actor Caviezel has repeated several QAnon phrases on conservative talk shows like \"andrenochroming,\" the false term used to describe the extraction of a substance from child victims to harvest the elixir of youth. He has also used other language of the movement (\"a big storm is coming\") and in 2021, attended a QAnon-adjacent conference.\nAside from QAnon believers, the movie is being championed by other notable conservative figures like Trump, who hosted a viewing party at his golf course with Caviezel and the agent who inspired his role in attendance.\nMonteverde, who did not attend, said the political ties from others were hurting his film, and he prefers to keep his distance.\nThe second controversy: Misleading portrayals of child trafficking\nIn Sound of Freedom, Caviezel as Ballard takes on a crime syndicate in Colombia after children are snatched by strangers.\nThis depiction has stoked concern from human and child trafficking experts who say while people can be kidnapped by strangers and trafficked, it's not the typical way it's done.\nREAD MORE My daughter was taken by a sex trafficker and now has a price tag on her\nTypically, it's done by someone who knows the person and exploits that trust.

Credit: Angel Studios Angel Studios is a self-described values-based company, though others call it faith-based, as it is behind a number of Christian movies and shows. Before distributing original content, Angel Studios made its brand by removing nudity, swearing and violence from mainstream movies and shows before it was sued by a number of well-known Hollywood studios for copyright.\nTo raise the $5m ($7.8m) the company needed to distribute and market the film, it crowdfunded the money from \"angel\" investors.\nOne of the film's many investors, Fabian Marta, was arrested on 23 July and charged as an accessory for child kidnapping in the US state of Missouri, NewsWeek reported. While the details of the case are not public, this charge carries a penalty of 10 to 30 years in prison or life imprisonment.\nThe fourth controversy: The Pay-It-Forward sales are misleading\nIt's true the film has been unexpectedly popular, grossing more than the latest Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones movies in the US.\nBut some of these sales are being called into question.\nIn the film's closing credits, the hero of the film, Caviezel, asks viewers to \u201c pay it forward \u201d by buying someone else a ticket. It's unclear how many of those tickets actually translated into actual views, but people online have noticed that the theatres have sometimes been more vacant than online seat availability suggests.\nOn the Angel Studios site, under the heading, \"How can I join the fight to end child trafficking?\" the creators say, \"Seeing the film is the first step in spreading awareness about child trafficking,\" before suggesting to pay it forward or claim a free ticket.\nPaying it forward will help you \"join a historical movement to promote stories that amplify light,\" it writes.\nIn the last paragraph, there is a link giving viewers a different resource (other than paying it forward).", "Matches": "21", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "SBS", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Tax changes, 'major disruptions', and an ageing Australia: Our future unpacked", "Url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/intergenerational-report-predicts-tax-changes-major-disruptions/h2minvvu4", "Rank": 6, "Text": "KEY POINTS: The Intergenerational Report has been released, giving a picture of Australia in 40 years.\nAustralia's population will be much older and more heavily dependent on aged care.\nThe IGR has also laid bare the impact climate change could have on future generations.\nAustralians have been given the clearest snapshot of what their country will look like four decades from now.\nThe sixth Intergenerational Report (IGR), released two years after the last one, warns of how an ageing population and sliding birth rate will hit the economy in 2063.\nIt also gives insight into climate change's devastating impact on the economy, why your taxes may need to change, and how our increasingly volatile region could alter the way we trade.\n\"These forces will influence the future path and structure of our economy and change how Australians live, work, and engage with the world,\" it says.\nHere are the key takeaways.\nClimate change to rock the economy\nThe impact of climate change is a key feature of this year's IGR, and it's grim reading.\n\"Floods, bushfires and other extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity, causing major disruptions to local economic activity and ultimately hindering overall economic output,\" it says.\nThe report outlines four key areas that will be particularly impacted by 2063 if temperatures rise above two degrees:\nProductivity\nAgriculture\nTourism\nNatural disaster spending\nThe impact of higher temperatures could wipe away between $135 billion and $423 billion in productivity over the next four decades, it says.\nHigher temperatures will force international tourists to adjust where they travel, and the report predicts the impact will be twice as bad if temperatures rise by three degrees instead of two.\nThe government could be spending three times as much responding to natural disasters, the report says. Source: AAP / Sean Davey And it warns that increasingly frequent bushfires, floods and cyclones will also force tourists to cancel, or simply not book, trips to Australia. It also expects the government will need to spend triple what it does now responding to natural disasters.\nFarmers are also set for punishment. The IGR expects crop yields to fall by up to 4 per cent, and that's before changes to rainfall patterns are taken into account.\nWorse still, the report warns climate change's \"indirect and cumulative\" consequences are likely to exacerbate these challenges.\nGlobal efforts to move away from fossil fuels will upend Australia's resources sector.\nIf temperature rises are capped at 1.5 per cent, the IGR expects international demand for Australian coal in 2063 to be just 1 per cent of current levels. But it tips other critical minerals to become increasingly profitable, with global demand for lithium to increase eight-fold.\nA bigger, older population\nAustralia is going to get much bigger, and much older.\nThat will mean big economic challenges.\nThere'll be an extra 14 million people in the country by 2063, with the population to grow past 40 million. But it's worth noting previous IGRs have underestimated population growth.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers speaks to the media during a press conference. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi This year's prediction is partially based on a rise in life expectancy - from 81 to 87 for men, and from 85 to 89 for women - resulting from better health treatment.\nThat will pose challenges for older Australians, and potentially impact their standard of living.\n\"Longevity risk - the risk of outliving savings \u2013 is a key concern for retirees in deciding how to draw down their superannuation,\" the report says.\nAnd younger Australians are having fewer children, which will also skew age demographics.\nThe number of people over 65 is going to more than double by 2063, and the number of people over 85 is going to more than triple.\nThat means the economy will need to change drastically.\nWe'll become much more reliant on a rapidly expanded care sector, which includes things such as health and aged care. While the sector currently accounts for around 8 per cent of GDP, the report predicts it'll be around 15 per cent by 2063.\n\"Part of this demand may be met by data and digital technologies increasing productivity and enabling more Australians to participate in work,\" the report says.\nAustralia's older population will make it increasingly reliant on aged care. Source: Getty / Maskot\nEconomy to slow, some costs to blow out\nLike other countries in the OECD (a group of 38 countries with advanced economies), economic growth is also expected to slow, largely as a result of the above.\nAnd spending in certain key areas - aged care, the NDIS, health, defence, and interest on the nation's debt - is set to balloon.\nThose five currently account for around a third of government spending, but that's set to rise to roughly half.\nWorkers carrying more of tax burden\nRegular workers are set to pick up a greater chunk of the tax burden over the next decade.\nThat's because the budget will come to more heavily rely on personal income tax, with GST and company tax set to remain stable.\nA proportionately smaller pool of working-age Australians, supporting a higher proportion of retirees needing health and aged care, will put extra pressure on the budget.\nThere'll also be a longer-term shift in where government can source its money.\nLabor has long encouraged Australians to buy electric vehicles, and the shift away from regular cars is expected to accelerate this decade partly due to tax incentives. But fewer petrol cars means the government recouping less from taxes on petrol.\nThere's also been a consistent decline in the number of young Australians taking up smoking. If that trend continues, that again means less revenue from taxing cigarettes. That was worth about $14 billion in 2020-21.\nGeopolitical risks to increase\nIncreasing tensions in our region will pose challenges for decades.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare weaknesses in the global supply chains, the IGR also notes that trade and investment have increasingly been used as \"tools of statecraft\".\nAustralia has certainly borne the brunt of that, after a series of trade sanctions imposed on its exports by China.\nThe report says that dynamic is likely to deepen, something that will require \"unprecedented\" coordination between Australia's domestic policy, foreign policy, and national security arms.\nAnd a hot war in the Indo-Pacific would have \"far-reaching consequences\" for our economy, it warns.", "Matches": "20", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "SBS", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Peter Dutton says ticks and crosses should count in Voice vote", "Url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/peter-dutton-says-ticks-and-crosses-should-count-in-voice-vote/7va9gilhi", "Rank": 4, "Text": "KEY POINTS: Peter Dutton says crosses should be considered a No vote in the Voice to Parliament referendum.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission says some ticks will count, but not crosses.\nAustralians are asked to write Yes or No on the ballot paper.\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton says voters should be able to validly use a tick or cross on their ballot paper for the Indigenous Voice referendum, accusing the Yes camp of attempting to \"skew\" the vote.\nThe comments come after Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers unintentionally triggered a debate by telling Sky News \"a tick will be accepted as a formal vote of Yes, but a cross will not be accepted as a formal vote\".\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese will announce the date of the referendum in Adelaide midway through next week.\nThe voting paper will require the word Yes or No to be written in a box.

However, according to his ex-wife, he missed life on the battlefield.\nRarely seen or heard from in public, he was last seen in a video posted by Prigozhin in July, in which the Wagner boss addressed fighters in Belarus, where they were sent after their aborted mutiny a month earlier.\nIn the video, Prigozhin introduces a man he says is Utkin; it was the first time the commander had been filmed speaking to his troops.\n\u201cThis is not the end, this is only the beginning of the greatest work in the world, which will continue very soon,\u201d Utkin says in the video. \u201cAnd welcome to hell,\u201d he adds, speaking the last words in English.\nAccording to the official passenger list published by Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation authority, several other senior Wagner members were onboard with Prigozhin when his plane crashed.\nAmong them was Valery Chekalov, a longtime Prigohzin ally who was believed to be in charge of his business empire. Chekalov was said to be overseeing Priogzhin\u2019s catering firm that provided food for schools across Russia and fed the military. Chekalov is said to have managed some of Prigozhin\u2019s business assets in Syria, including his investment in oil in the war-torn country.\nAccording to Russian independent media, Chekalov was in charge of Prigozhin\u2019s travel arrangements, making him one of the only people aware of the warlord\u2019s secretive movements. He was also responsible for Prigozhin\u2019s personal security and had been accused by journalists of leading harassment campaigns against them.\nThe US imposed sanctions on Chekalov last month over his links to Prigozhin and for facilitating munitions shipments to Russia.\nSeveral veteran Wagner commanders were also listed by Rosaviatsia as being onboard, including Evgeniy Makaryan.\nMakaryan joined Wagner in 2016 and fought as part of the mercenary group during Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria. He was reportedly injured in the Battle of Khasham, where hundreds of Russian mercenaries perished after US airstrikes against pro-Assad forces.\nMembers of Prigozhin\u2019s personal security guard were also listed among the passengers killed, including Sergey Propustin, a Chechen war veteran who joined Wagner in 2015.\nWhile the crash killed much of Wagner\u2019s leadership, a number of veteran commanders remain alive. But they lack Prigozhin\u2019s charisma, economic powers and political connections, raising serious questions over the mercenary group\u2019s future.", "Matches": "13", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "The Guardian", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "\u2018They\u2019re savage animals\u2019: Trump attacks the left in Tucker Carlson interview", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/23/donald-trump-tucker-carlson-interview", "Rank": 8, "Text": "Donald Trump has warned of a threat of conflict in the US after saying that he expects the Democrats to steal the 2024 election from him.\nThe former US president also suggested to Tucker Carlson, in a Twitter interview with the far-right former Fox News host staged to undermine the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, that he is concerned \u201cthe left\u201d will try to kill him.\nIn a rambling interview, speckled with discussion of conspiracy theories from whether the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his jail cell to the role of federal agencies limiting the amount of water in washing machines, Trump took aim at critics on all sides in his traditional derisory fashion.\nBut the social media broadcast took a dark turn when, after discussion of the numerous criminal charges against Trump and divisions in the US, Carlson asked if he thinks the US is headed to \u201ccivil war\u201d and \u201copen conflict\u201d.\nTrump said he didn\u2019t know but then added: \u201cI can say this.

They are people that are sick, really sick,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cYou have great people that are Democrats. Most of the people in our country are fantastic. And I\u2019m representing everybody \u2026 But I\u2019ve seen what they do.\u201d\nCarlson, who is engaged in a protracted dispute with his former network after being taken off air, launched the interview five minutes before the Republican debate aired on Fox. If that was an attempt to upstage both Trump\u2019s rivals in the 2024 election and Carlson\u2019s ex-employer, then it would appear to have been successful. The interview had more than 80m views on Twitter within two hours of being posted.\nCarlson opened with a question about why Trump wasn\u2019t at the Milwaukee debate.\n\u201cYou see the polls that have come out and I\u2019m leading by 50 and 60 points and some of them are at one and zero and two. And I\u2019m saying do I sit there for an hour or two hours or whatever it\u2019s going to be and get harassed by people who shouldn\u2019t even be running for president?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI just felt it would be more appropriate not to do the debate.\u201d\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The case, which shocked New Zealanders, has also prompted public debate over how the men were able to prey on young women for four years, and whether it reflects a wider culture of sexual violence and misogyny.\nThe two men, Danny and Roberto Jaz, 40 and 38 years old, sexually assaulted 18 patrons of Mama Hooch and Venuti, a well-known downtown bar and restaurant in Christchurch which was owned by their father, who is not accused of any wrongdoing. Many of the women were teenagers or in their early 20s at the time. Danny Jaz was the bar\u2019s manager, and Roberto was a chef at Venuti and sometimes worked at the bar. The two men were born and raised in Australia, but moved to New Zealand in the early 2000s.\nThe brothers drugged a number of their victims, and had a WhatsApp group where they discussed assaults, date-rape drugs, and exchanged photos planning which women to target. Roberto sexually assaulted five young women, including one whom he filmed being raped at the restaurant.\nDanny assaulted 15, a number of whom he followed into the bar\u2019s bathrooms before attacking. They were collectively convicted of 69 charges, including rape, indecent assault, sexual violation, supplying illicit drugs, stupefying and disabling, and making intimate recordings of women without their consent.\n\u201cThe level of your offending is unknown in this country,\u201d judge Paul Mabey said as he sentenced the brothers on Thursday. \u201cYou helped yourself to young women with callous disregard for their rights and their dignity, their youth.\u201d\nHe imposed a minimum period of imprisonment of 50% for both men \u2013 meaning they must serve half their sentence before being eligible for parole.\nSix women presented statements in court on Thursday, detailing the impact the crimes had had on them. Some read their statements standing side-by-side to support each other.\n\u201cYou stole my fierce independence from me \u2026 for those things I\u2019ll never forgive you,\u201d said Sophie Brown, 25, who was drugged and sexually assaulted by Danny Jaz at 19. She waived her name suppression to discuss the case, and can be identified. Brown spoke about the effect of Danny\u2019s crimes, but also of the wider rates of sexual violence against women in New Zealand. \u201cI believe you have a daughter, she will be 19 one day \u2026 she continues to live in a world where [the chances of] running into a man like you are one in four.\u201c\nA 27-year-old who was drugged and indecently assaulted by Danny said that she now planned to pursue a career in the police, \u201cto fight for the validation of women \u2026 and fight for them to be believed\u201d.\nWhile Danny pleaded guilty to some of the sexual assault charges, neither brother has expressed remorse for their crimes. They stood expressionless in the dock as victim impact statements were read.\n\u201cNeither of you have expressed any remorse, empathy or feelings,\u201d judge Paul Mabey said. \u201cYou lied. You minimised. You demonstrated an arrogant belief that you could talk yourself out of anything\u201d.\nWhile he had received a series of character references for the men, the judge said, \u201cyou are not men of good character, you are sexual predators\u201d.\nCrown prosecutor Andrew McRae said New Zealand had seen no other cases such as this in terms of the scale and type of offending. The case has sent ripples through the country, with an outpouring of anger and support for the survivors.\nOn Thursday, a group of women in Christchurch \u2013 where the attacks occurred \u2013 took out full page advertisements to print an open letter in the city\u2019s newspapers.\nAddressing the victims of the Jaz brothers, they said: \u201cKnow that your voices have made a profound difference. You stopped future hurt at the hands of these offenders.\u201d\n\u201cTo all who have reported sexual violence, who have endured lengthy court proceedings, who have withstood the mental repercussions, we are in awe of you.\u201d\nGiven New Zealand\u2019s high rates of domestic and sexual violence, some advocates say the case reflects a broader culture threaded with misogyny and sexual violence. \u201cThe sexual violence that happened to the young women at Mama Hooch was not an isolated incident,\u201d Marama Davidson, minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence, said in July in written comments on the case.\nWhile she had seen an outpouring of \u201cdisgust\u201d from New Zealanders, Davidson said, \u201cThese two men are not just \u201cmonsters\u201d that we can conveniently dissociate ourselves from. They are part of a culture that is affirmed by this country\u2019s longstanding attitudes towards women.\u201d\nAccording to the Ministry of Justice, 30% of New Zealander experience intimate partner violence or sexual violence at some point in their life, with women three times more likely to experience sexual violence than men. Ninety-four percent of sexual assaults in New Zealand are not reported to police.", "Matches": "11", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "The Guardian", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Was Lucy Letby an unlikely serial killer? To most people, yes \u2013 but not psychologists", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/lucy-letby-serial-killer-forensic-psychologist-murderer", "Rank": 6, "Text": "The crimes of the convicted serial killer Lucy Letby have rattled the UK and the world. One can think of nothing worse: babies who were grievously ill, killed or injured by a woman who was meant to care for them. Why was Letby able to kill so many young victims? Why wasn\u2019t she recognised as a murderer sooner?\nSome are saying that Letby\u2019s case is a \u201cone-off\u201d, and is thus difficult to process or learn from. While serial murder is rare, to those of us in the field of serial homicide research, the crimes and victims of Letby are less surprising. In many ways, Letby fits the profile for the \u201ctypical\u201d female serial killer (FSK) that my team and I compiled for The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology in 2015. By analysing cases in the US, we found that nearly 40% of female serial killers are nurses, nurses\u2019 aides or other healthcare workers.\nOur analysis showed that a FSK is likely to be white, probably Christian, average looking or attractive, and in her 20s or 30s when the crimes start. She has an elevated probability of being a healthcare worker, often in charge of caring for those who are helpless. Those familiar to her are at risk, especially vulnerable people such as infants and the sick. She may murder for money or power. She may be arrogant or at times withdrawn, and may have experienced a recent relationship issue. Experts such as Eric Hickey and Patricia Pearson have also compiled information about FSK backgrounds, crimes, motives and victims.\nThe caveat is that a forensic profile is an imperfect predictor of future crimes, and the description above probably applies to many nurses you know. Moreover, almost every nurse or medical professional who has ever lived would never harm anyone. We created a composite FSK profile based on frequencies and trends in previous cases that we hoped would serve as a starting point \u2013 a statistical tool for investigating suspected female-perpetrated serial homicide offences.\nIn fairness, too, Letby did not check some of the boxes in our profile. Most FSKs have been married; Letby never was. Most FSKs do not keep souvenirs of their crimes; Letby kept bags of patient records and a diary with victim initials and their death dates. In our analysis we found a documented history of mental illness in about 40% of FSK cases. I have seen no reports yet that Letby has such a history. Many FSKs had parental issues. It is my understanding that Letby\u2019s parents were supportive to the point of attending her trial every day. Yet the profile is a starting point for whom and what to look for when serial murder is suspected.\nSo how can we make sure that law enforcement and the public have access to what we know about FSKs as an investigative tool? My 2015 article about FSKs is reported to be the most-read article in the journal\u2019s history. But the point is moot if the information isn\u2019t disseminated to people who can use it. We can try to do better.\nIt does seem bewildering that administrators at Countess of Chester hospital failed to recognise Letby\u2019s crimes after doctors raised concerns . Some outlets have put the hospital\u2019s reaction down to a \u201ca culture of arrogance\u201d. As a research psychologist, however, I can offer a different perspective, and one that I offer to law enforcement when given the opportunity to engage with them.\nWe all have a \u201cschema\u201d \u2013 a cognitive framework \u2013 of how people, places and things typically operate to help us process the world around us. We create each schema from the slew of information we have encountered in our previous experiences. Evidence repeatedly shows that we find it very difficult to process or believe information that does not fit our schemas. We have a schema for \u201cnurse\u201d. A nurse is a skilled and compassionate caretaker. A nurse monitors, nourishes and soothes. \u201cKiller\u201d does not fit into our \u201cnurse\u201d schema.\nMore broadly, we also have a gender schema. Fairly or not, people have a preconceived notion of what we feel a \u201cwoman\u201d and a \u201cman\u201d ought to be, based on our previous encounters and feedback. Evidence shows that, throughout history, women are typically perceived as nurturing, caring and kind. Most people are not ready to believe that a woman can kill.\nNow think of \u201cfemale nurse\u201d, and how \u201cmurderer\u201d is probably brushed off as being impossible.\nThe initial failures of the Countess of Chester hospital echoes what we have seen in previous FSK cases. Other hospital-based serial killers such as Kristen Gilbert, Reta Mays and Genene Jones killed multiple helpless victims before hospital authorities realised that the deaths were unnatural. When I give training talks to law enforcement (while acknowledging that their crime-solving skills are exponentially more developed than mine), I challenge them to drop their schemas. If you think a woman will not kill or a nurse will not kill, then think again.\nOn the heels of the Letby case, what can we do to stop this type of homicide, or at least to limit the number of future victims? As mentioned previously, we can become aware of the science out there, and perhaps we in the scientific community can do a better job of disseminating information. In addition, we can learn to look beyond our preconceived notions of who a murderer might be. One must be ready and willing to recognise that a crime is happening, even if the suspect seems unlikely based on our preconceived ideas.\nOf Letby, Detective Ch Insp Nicola Evans said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything outstanding or outrageous about her as a person.\u201d This is reminiscent of the Mays case in West Virginia in the US, when District Judge Thomas Kleeh, sentencing Mays to life in prison for murdering seven elderly veterans under her hospital care, told her: \u201cYou are the monster no one sees coming.\u201d We must be prepared to recognise that, sometimes, the monster is a vanilla nurse who took dance lessons, fancied a staff doctor, and had teddy bears, fairy lights and a polka-dot dressing gown in her bedroom; an otherwise ordinary woman who took salsa lessons and a holiday with friends in Ibiza, and yet destroyed lives in a most extraordinary way.", "Matches": "10", "Num matches": 1}, {"publication": "ABC", "scraped_datetime": "13AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Donald Trump hands himself in over Georgia election indictment", "Url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-25/donald-trump-arrives-in-georgia-to-hand-himself-on-indictment/102774792", "Rank": 2, "Text": "Donald Trump has handed himself in to authorities at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, for processing over his fourth indictment.\nKey points: Donald Trump flew to Atlanta to be arrested over an alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia\nDonald Trump flew to Atlanta to be arrested over an alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia Before his arrival, his lawyers had negotiated the conditions of his immediate release, including $312,000 bail\nBefore his arrival, his lawyers had negotiated the conditions of his immediate release, including $312,000 bail After the short booking process, Donald Trump left the jail\nThe former US president flew to the southern city from his New Jersey golf club to be arrested over an alleged conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results.\n\"I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia,\" he told his social media followers earlier today, \"to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for a PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED AND STOLLEN (sic) ELECTION.\"\nOfficials in Atlanta cleared roads for Mr Trump's journey from the airport to the jail.\nAfter making the short drive in a motorcade followed by news helicopters, he arrived at about 7:30pm local time (9:30am AEST).\nDonald Trump entered the jail through an entrance away from the crowds.
