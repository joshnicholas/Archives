Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the private military company the Wagner Group, led a short but high-profile insurrection that saw his troops advance to within 300 kilometres of Moscow. The main casualties of the day were from the Russian Air Force, which lost multiple helicopters and other aircraft.

He also said well-established rules, called \u201csavings provisions\u201d, allow AEC staff to count votes which don\u2019t strictly follow such instructions.\n\u201cIt is likely that a \u2018y\u2019 or an \u2018n\u2019 would be counted under the savings provisions. But I get nervous even talking about that because then people hear mixed messages. It\u2019s just important to write either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on that ballot paper,\u201d Rogers said.\n\u201cIt is likely that a tick will be accepted as a formal vote for yes but a cross will not be accepted as a formal vote.\u201d\nThe claims were leapt upon by Fair Australia, the referendum no campaign from conservative group Advance, as well as Dutton and Abbott. Fair Australia tweeted: \u201cLooks like just another attempt to stack the deck against \u2018no\u2019 voting Australians.\u201d\nAbbott claimed on 2GB that \u201cthere\u2019s a suspicion that officialdom is trying to make it easier for one side \u2026 this is the worry all along that there is a lot of official bias in this whole referendum process.\u201d\nDutton, also speaking on 2GB, called it \u201ccompletely outrageous\u201d and claimed the situation \u201cgives a very, very strong advantage to the \u2018yes\u2019 case\u201d. The opposition leader said he would ask the government to draft legislation to change the rule.\nThe Coalition opposition did not propose amending this rule during debate on the referendum machinery act earlier this year, and supported the government\u2019s legislation. A government source called Dutton\u2019s claims \u201cfantasy\u201d, noting the same voting rules applied at federal elections.\nThe AEC says this rule has been in place for 30 years, since 1988, and that the rules about savings provisions had been in place for six referendums since then. The AEC also said that in the 1999 referendum, only 0.86% of votes were classed as informal, and only a portion of those related to ticks and crosses on the ballot.\nThe ballot paper given to Australians will clearly tell voters \u201cwrite yes or no\u201d, on two separate occasions.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To most people, yes \u2013 but not psychologists", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/lucy-letby-serial-killer-forensic-psychologist-murderer", "Rank": 5, "Text": "The crimes of the convicted serial killer Lucy Letby have rattled the UK and the world. One can think of nothing worse: babies who were grievously ill, killed or injured by a woman who was meant to care for them. Why was Letby able to kill so many young victims? Why wasn\u2019t she recognised as a murderer sooner?\nSome are saying that Letby\u2019s case is a \u201cone-off\u201d, and is thus difficult to process or learn from. While serial murder is rare, to those of us in the field of serial homicide research, the crimes and victims of Letby are less surprising. In many ways, Letby fits the profile for the \u201ctypical\u201d female serial killer (FSK) that my team and I compiled for The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology in 2015. By analysing cases in the US, we found that nearly 40% of female serial killers are nurses, nurses\u2019 aides or other healthcare workers.\nOur analysis showed that a FSK is likely to be white, probably Christian, average looking or attractive, and in her 20s or 30s when the crimes start. She has an elevated probability of being a healthcare worker, often in charge of caring for those who are helpless. Those familiar to her are at risk, especially vulnerable people such as infants and the sick. She may murder for money or power. She may be arrogant or at times withdrawn, and may have experienced a recent relationship issue. Experts such as Eric Hickey and Patricia Pearson have also compiled information about FSK backgrounds, crimes, motives and victims.\nThe caveat is that a forensic profile is an imperfect predictor of future crimes, and the description above probably applies to many nurses you know. Moreover, almost every nurse or medical professional who has ever lived would never harm anyone. We created a composite FSK profile based on frequencies and trends in previous cases that we hoped would serve as a starting point \u2013 a statistical tool for investigating suspected female-perpetrated serial homicide offences.\nIn fairness, too, Letby did not check some of the boxes in our profile. Most FSKs have been married; Letby never was. Most FSKs do not keep souvenirs of their crimes; Letby kept bags of patient records and a diary with victim initials and their death dates. In our analysis we found a documented history of mental illness in about 40% of FSK cases. I have seen no reports yet that Letby has such a history. Many FSKs had parental issues. It is my understanding that Letby\u2019s parents were supportive to the point of attending her trial every day. Yet the profile is a starting point for whom and what to look for when serial murder is suspected.\nSo how can we make sure that law enforcement and the public have access to what we know about FSKs as an investigative tool? My 2015 article about FSKs is reported to be the most-read article in the journal\u2019s history. But the point is moot if the information isn\u2019t disseminated to people who can use it. We can try to do better.\nIt does seem bewildering that administrators at Countess of Chester hospital failed to recognise Letby\u2019s crimes after doctors raised concerns . Some outlets have put the hospital\u2019s reaction down to a \u201ca culture of arrogance\u201d. As a research psychologist, however, I can offer a different perspective, and one that I offer to law enforcement when given the opportunity to engage with them.\nWe all have a \u201cschema\u201d \u2013 a cognitive framework \u2013 of how people, places and things typically operate to help us process the world around us. We create each schema from the slew of information we have encountered in our previous experiences. Evidence repeatedly shows that we find it very difficult to process or believe information that does not fit our schemas. We have a schema for \u201cnurse\u201d. A nurse is a skilled and compassionate caretaker. A nurse monitors, nourishes and soothes. \u201cKiller\u201d does not fit into our \u201cnurse\u201d schema.\nMore broadly, we also have a gender schema. Fairly or not, people have a preconceived notion of what we feel a \u201cwoman\u201d and a \u201cman\u201d ought to be, based on our previous encounters and feedback. Evidence shows that, throughout history, women are typically perceived as nurturing, caring and kind. Most people are not ready to believe that a woman can kill.\nNow think of \u201cfemale nurse\u201d, and how \u201cmurderer\u201d is probably brushed off as being impossible.\nThe initial failures of the Countess of Chester hospital echoes what we have seen in previous FSK cases. Other hospital-based serial killers such as Kristen Gilbert, Reta Mays and Genene Jones killed multiple helpless victims before hospital authorities realised that the deaths were unnatural. When I give training talks to law enforcement (while acknowledging that their crime-solving skills are exponentially more developed than mine), I challenge them to drop their schemas. If you think a woman will not kill or a nurse will not kill, then think again.\nOn the heels of the Letby case, what can we do to stop this type of homicide, or at least to limit the number of future victims? As mentioned previously, we can become aware of the science out there, and perhaps we in the scientific community can do a better job of disseminating information. In addition, we can learn to look beyond our preconceived notions of who a murderer might be. One must be ready and willing to recognise that a crime is happening, even if the suspect seems unlikely based on our preconceived ideas.\nOf Letby, Detective Ch Insp Nicola Evans said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything outstanding or outrageous about her as a person.\u201d This is reminiscent of the Mays case in West Virginia in the US, when District Judge Thomas Kleeh, sentencing Mays to life in prison for murdering seven elderly veterans under her hospital care, told her: \u201cYou are the monster no one sees coming.\u201d We must be prepared to recognise that, sometimes, the monster is a vanilla nurse who took dance lessons, fancied a staff doctor, and had teddy bears, fairy lights and a polka-dot dressing gown in her bedroom; an otherwise ordinary woman who took salsa lessons and a holiday with friends in Ibiza, and yet destroyed lives in a most extraordinary way.", "Matches": "9", "Num matches": 1.0}, {"publication": "The Guardian", "scraped_datetime": "07AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Reforms needed after \u2018horrendous\u2019 Catholic church approach in paedophile priest cases, lawyers say", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/25/reforms-needed-after-horrendous-catholic-church-approach-in-paedophile-priest-cases-lawyers-say", "Rank": 4, "Text": "Lawyers for two Indigenous abuse survivors have called for reforms to address the \u201chorrendous\u201d Catholic church strategy of seeking to permanently block cases where alleged paedophile priests have died.\nOn Wednesday, the church was successful in permanently blocking a claim made by two Indigenous survivors relating to alleged abuse committed by David Joseph Perrett, an Armidale assistant priest and convicted child abuser, whose crimes the church has known about since 1995.\nPerrett died in 2020, awaiting trial for alleged abuse against 40 children, including the two Indigenous men, who alleged they were molested by Perrett in 1976 during a camping trip from their Aboriginal mission in Armidale.\nThe Indigenous men sought civil compensation through the courts five months after Perrett\u2019s death, but the church on Wednesday obtained permanent stays, preventing their cases from going to trial. They successfully argued the death of Perrett and other witnesses meant it could no longer obtain the material it needed to prepare a defence and fairly participate in the trial, despite allegations from the survivors\u2019 lawyers that it had ample opportunity to anticipate and prepare for civil claims while Perret was alive.\nThe diocese has known he was a convicted child abuser since 1995, heard a confession from Perrett that he was a paedophile in 2016, and knew of more criminal charges against him in 2017, three years before his death. Those charges included the allegations made by the two Indigenous men who later sued, though the church says it was oblivious to their identity.\nAn investigation by the Guardian earlier this year revealed the church and other institutions are now routinely seeking permanent stays where perpetrators have died, a strategy widely condemned \u2013 including by the former head of the church\u2019s response to the royal commission, Francis Sullivan \u2013 as a moral failing, a failure of leadership and another layer of abuse for survivors.\nPlaintiff lawyers say the threat of permanent stays is also being used during settlement negotiations to force survivors to accept paltry sums or risk having their cases halted permanently by the courts.\nRoss Koffel, managing principal at Koffels Solicitors & Barristers, which represented the two survivors in the Perrett case, said the need for reform was clear.\nThe high court is expected to soon hand down a landmark judgment in one stay case, that of GLJ, which could potentially change the way stays are treated by Australian courts.\n\u201cSubject to what happens in GLJ with the high court, if that doesn\u2019t provide some relief against the applications that are being made, then it requires legislative intervention,\u201d Koffel told the Guardian. \u201cThere is little doubt that the way in which the stay cases have progressed means that the so-called extraordinary circumstances have been applied to ordinary cases, and I think that\u2019s the very problem.\u201d\nThe Australian Lawyers Alliance spokesperson and barrister Dr Andrew Morrison KC said he believes reform will be needed regardless of what happens in the high court.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of continuing concern and New South Wales is easily the worst place in Australia on permanent stays, with Queensland a little distance behind,\u201d he said.\nThe deaths of witnesses is common in historical abuse cases, as is the absence of records.\nThat is partly due to the length of time survivors take to come forward \u2013 22 years, on average \u2013 and partly due to the church\u2019s own role in concealing abuse complaints.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the church knew the harm such a strategy was causing survivors, but was pursuing it regardless.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just horrendous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just inconsistent, one would think, with the principles of which the church is founded.

It could come back but they just don\u2019t have a lot of credibility, Tucker, you know that perhaps better than anybody. I think it was a terrible move getting rid of you. You were number one on television and all of a sudden we\u2019re doing this interview, but we\u2019ll get bigger ratings using this crazy forum that you\u2019re using than probably, probably the debate, our competition.\u201d\nYou know your career is circling the drain when your big interview guest spends his time reminiscing about the good old days when you were number one, long before you ended up on this crazy website, whatever it\u2019s called nowadays, where we maybe, possibly, probably will do better than the debate.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, despite all the incoherent blather that spills out of Trump\u2019s mouth like endless rain into a paper cup, his fans believe. They truly, deeply believe every morsel of moronic nonsense that he plucks out of the ether that separates his brain cells.\nA recent CBS News poll revealed that Trump voters trust the twice-impeached, quadruple-indicted ex-president more than their own friends, family, religious leaders, and even (gulp) conservative media figures like Tucker Carlson.\nListening to the two of them talk on Thursday night, you can understand why.\nTucker asked Trump not once but twice why his attorney general Bill Barr thought that the notorious rapist Jeffrey Epstein had killed himself in prison.

But Tucker persisted, like the rottweiler interviewer he is.\n\u201cI think he probably committed suicide,\u201d said Trump.\nTucker asked Donald not once but twice if he thought that after impeachment and indictment, the left was surely going to try to kill him. As in, literally assassinate him.\nDonald just said they were savage animals and left it there, hanging in the Twitter/X space like the promise of self-driving Teslas.\nSure, sure. There was plenty of weird stuff from Donald. He called Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor, \u201cAda\u201d, and described Hutchinson as a seriously nasty thing that was so nasty he couldn\u2019t explain why. He called Chris Christie a lunatic. He said Joe Biden couldn\u2019t walk on grass or sand.\nHe even claimed to have saved the Tokyo Olympics by getting North Korean athletes to take part. Which is the kind of thing that can haunt you, late at night, if you try too hard to understand what he\u2019s saying.\nBut then Tucker said Biden had skinny legs, and Kamala Harris was senile too, and that one of his old Fox News co-workers was a small man. He even claimed that Trump\u2019s indictments weren\u2019t \u201cworking\u201d because Trump\u2019s poll numbers were going up.

( ABC Riverina: Conor Burke )\nDuring a recent visit to the lake, Premier Chris Minns said he hoped the funding would help to inform a \"comprehensive policy response\" to MND in the state.\nA $22 million dollar project to improve water quality is also underway, but the council has warned it would take years to complete.\nNeurologist and researcher Professor Dominic Rowe said while the funding was a \"good start\" it remained unclear how the money would be spent and that even more investment was needed.\nProfessor Rowe, who is also the head of Macquarie University's Motor Neurone Disease Research Centre, said accurate figures were difficult to pin down because the average survival time after a diagnosis was just over two years.\nMND affects the body's ability to get messages to the brain that allow us to make voluntary movements like walking, talking, and breathing.\n\"You don't die from motor neurone disease, it kills you,\" Professor Rowe said.\n\"And it is an awful, awful death.\"\nHe said MND should be designated as a notifiable disease so that the Department of Health is notified every time a diagnosis is made.\n\"We need to redouble our efforts as to why patients \u2014 in Leeton, in Narrandera, in Wagga, in Griffith, in Balranald, in Barellan, in Hay \u2014 why are they developing motor neurone disease?\" Professor Rowe said.\n\"And it's going to have to be adequately resourced.\"\nBlue-green algae a potential risk factor\nUp to 10 per cent of MND cases can be attributed to genetics, but it is the other 90 per cent that continues to vex academics.\nLifestyle factors like smoking and working with certain chemicals has been shown to increase the likelihood of MND, and research on links to algal blooms date back to the late 1980s.\nBut as yet there is no consensus.\nProfessor Dominic Rowe says more people will die each year of MND without more funding and more government focus. ( ABC News: Joyce Wong )\nProfessor Rowe said the disease killed more than 700 people a year, and in the past 30 years the number of deaths caused by MND had surged by more than 250 per cent in Australia.\n\"This year, 250 people in our state are going to die from this disease,\" he said.\n\"Is it OK to say we don't know the cause?\"\nProfessor Rowe said one theory was that a toxin produced by blue-green algae called beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) might be one environmental risk factor for some people.\nHe said the dramatic increase in MND rates suggested environmental factors were at play, potentially even for people who have a family history.\n\"That's called epigenetic, so as the environment interacts with genes, then perhaps that could be involved in how the disease becomes manifest,\" Professor Rowe said.\nWhile algae blooms are being researched as a potential risk factor, not everyone would be susceptible and not all people who are genetically predisposed succumb to the disease.\nLake Wyangan, which is prone to blue-green algae blooms, pictured in 2020. ( ABC News: Ben Deacon )\nThree generations of Ms Vearing's family, which has a genetic predisposition to the disease, have been diagnosed with MND, starting with her grandfather in 1996.\nThree months after her mother was diagnosed she could not talk, eat, or swallow.\nBy six months she was wheelchair-bound and within 12 months she had died.\n\"She couldn't kiss us. She couldn't hug us. She couldn't tell us that she loved us.

Got it Share\nFrom the lasagne-filled ravioli made by Latina Fresh, to eggplant parmigiana tortellini from Rana, the fresh pasta in the refrigerated section of your local supermarket has evolved and expanded. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a change driven by increasing interest in supermarket meals, as consumers swap restaurant dishes for ready-made convenience during the cost of living crisis. Data from an NAB consumer report released in July showed that 55 per cent of 2000 consumers surveyed were willing to cut down on eating out or buying takeaway meals as a way of balancing their budgets. Ready-made meals offer an attractive alternative, with fresh pasta ready to eat in under five minutes for as little as $2.50 per serve. Quarantine pasta sauce with tuna and olives by Katrina Meynink. Katrina Meynink Quarantine sauce: Turn one tomato sauce into 10 dinners \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the last year, we have seen a growth in fresh pasta sales as customers look for more gourmet options at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesperson for Woolworths tells Good Food.\nAdvertisement\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe know many customers are looking for more ways to get value out of their shop and with our fresh pasta range, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing restaurant quality to the kitchen table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Both major supermarkets now offer more than 20 varieties of fresh pasta, and Coles has recently introduced several home brand options targeted at vegans (Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kitchen) and athletes (Perform Build). Across Australia, revenue in the pasta market is expected to grow by 3.65 per cent over the next year. With all of these new choices, it can be difficult to tell how the pasta will cook and eat from a quick glance at the options in the refrigerator aisle. So I decided to put them to the test. Choosing both filled ricotta and cheese pasta and simple strands of fresh supermarket pasta from Coles and Woolworths (with a few wild cards thrown in), I considered the following factors when determining my ranking:\nAdvertisement\nColour (and where the colour comes from)\nLength\nCooking time\nTexture\nFlavour\nValue For this taste test, I used Katrina Meynink\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarantine sauce. One pot makes about 10 dinners and includes two cups of white wine (leaving you two glasses to sip while the sauce simmers). Be aware, the sauce\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four-hour cooking time means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to get cracking in the afternoon if you want to eat dinner at a reasonable time. Each pasta was cooked according its package instructions, with a big pinch of sea salt in plenty of boiling water. Salt enhances the flavour of the pasta, making it an important step for any pasta you choose to cook. It was then drained and tested both before and after adding the sauce. Fresh supermarket filled spinach and ricotta pasta (ranked from worst to best) Coles spinach and ricotta agnolotti.\nAdvertisement\nColes spinach and ricotta agnolotti, $5 for 600 g Serves four, ready in three minutes The mildly flavoured spinach and ricotta filling was thick and pasty in this budget Coles option, frequently sticking to the roof of my mouth (blergh). There were also quite a few empty pasta pockets. But you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat it for price, coming in at just $1.25 per serve. 25degrees South baby spinach and fetta ravioli. 25degrees South baby spinach and Victoria fetta ravioli, $9 for 325 g\nAdvertisement\nServes two, ready in three minutes 25degrees South is channelling farm-to-table restaurant vibes with the packaging, but the ravioli isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite there. In a pot of boiling water the big, delicate pillows of pasta fall apart quickly, letting the filling escape. What remains is flavoursome but water-logged, and difficult to eat. Leggo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fresh ricotta and spinach agnolotti. Leggo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ricotta and spinach agnolotti with parmesan, $9 for 630 g Serves four, ready in five minutes\nAdvertisement\nThis is a good option for families at $2.25 per serve. The filling is a pale green paste with a barely perceptible flavour of parmesan. Still, it emerges al dente after five minutes and gets the job done. Grand Italian ricotta and spinach agnolotti. Grand Italian ricotta and spinach agnolotti, $6 for 325 g Serves two, ready in four minutes Creamy mascarpone and aged grana padano cheese are added to the classic ricotta and spinach pairing for \u00e2\u0080\u009cextra flavour\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m struggling to taste it. This is a relatively bland option with thick pasta, best suited for when you want the flavours of your pasta sauce to really shine.\nAdvertisement\nLatina Fresh ricotta and spinach agnolotti, $8.50 for 625 g Serves four, ready in five minutes The packaging promises this is a new recipe, with more filling and thinner pasta. The smooth mixture of Australian-made ricotta, parmesan and spinach has a subtle but notably cheesy flavour. The pasta still errs on the thicker side, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty nice with a generous serving of quarantine sauce. WINNER Rana ricotta and spinach tortellini, $8 for 325 g Serves two, ready in two minutes\nAdvertisement\nItalian favourite Rana has nailed this one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a simple, creamy filling with a comparatively greater percentage of ricotta and spinach, encased in thin sheets of fresh pasta. Each mouthful is a satisfying pop of flavour, sweet and a little citrusy. Wildcards: Are they worth it? Latina Fresh vegetarian broccoli and potato, $8 for 375 g Serves two, ready in two minutes Does anyone else have a core childhood memory of eating sad, wet broccoli after your mum boiled it for too long? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this green filling reminds me of. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely off-putting, but it certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my favourite either (especially for the price).\nAdvertisement\nColes Perform Build high-protein vegetable ravioli. Coles Perform Build high protein vegetable ravioli, $6 for 360 g Serves two, ready in three minutes Does it taste like anything? No (at least, not that I can tell). Does it make me feel better to know that one serve contains roughly half of my daily protein intake? Yes. For gym-goers who are tired of meal prepping the same high-protein dinners day in, day out, it could offer an inoffensive and quick alternative. Coles Angus beef ravioli.\nAdvertisement\nColes Finest free-range egg ravioli with Angus beef ragu and grana padano, $6 for 350 g Serves two, ready in 1.5 minutes Giovanni Di Sebastiano and his family have made pasta in Melbourne for more than 30 years, so I had high hopes for this Coles collaboration. The pasta itself is great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 big pillows of delicate pasta, cooked al dente. And the filling is generous, coming right out to the edges, all rich and meaty. But there is something about the sinewy texture that just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for me. 25degrees South three cheese ravioli. 25degrees South Victorian three cheese ravioli, $9 for 325 g\nAdvertisement\nServes two, ready in three minutes These large, soft pillows of pasta pack a real punch. With a generous filling of Gippsland milk ricotta, mascarpone and pecorino wrapped in silky cracked pepper pasta, this is a flavourful option reminiscent of cacio e pepe. After three minutes the pasta is al dente and best paired with a simple buttery sauce. WINNER Rana eggplant parmigiana tortellini, $5 for 325 g Serves two, ready in two minutes What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to love about this tortellini? It ticks all the boxes: a creamy filling; a soft and quick-cooking pasta that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall apart; and a subtle, cheesy, tomatoey flavour that would complement many types of sauce. If I ever feel like eating filled pasta from the supermarket again (doubtful), this is the one I will buy.\nAdvertisement\nFresh non-filled supermarket pasta (ranked from worst to best) What makes a good fresh non-filled supermarket pasta? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re softer and more supple than their dried pastas and better suited to smooth, saucy dishes. But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also easy to overcook, prone to tearing and considerably more expensive than the dry stuff. Latina Fresh gluten-free tagliatelle, $8.75 for 280g\nServes two, ready in two minutes The first thing I noticed about this pasta was how sticky it was once cooked. That makes it great for picking up sauce, but the rubbery mouthfeel wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for me. It was also very yellow, likely due to the addition of carotene in an attempt to better mimic the look of wheat-based egg pasta. Add on that price tag ($4.37 per serve) and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving this one to the coeliacs. Coles fresh pappardelle.\nAdvertisement\nColes pasta pappardelle, $4.20 for 300g\nServes two, ready in three minutes A good pappardelle pasta should be long and thick, with a slightly rougher texture to really pick up all that delicious sauce. This one missed the mark, with super short, dense strands of pasta that stuck together in boiling water and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adhere well to the sauce. iPastai fresh pappardelle. iPastai pappardelle, $5 for 350g\nServes three, ready in two minutes The sunshine yellow strands of thick pappardelle pasta looked great in the cardboard gingham packaging, but struggled to separate in boiling water. They emerged, despite my best efforts, still clinging together. This is a heavy and doughy pasta that retains its structure under repeated fork stabbings and the weight of a heartier sauce. Plus, at just $1.60 per serve, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good value.\nAdvertisement\nLatina Fresh classic egg fettuccine, $6 for 375g\nServes two, ready in two minutes This pasta looks fresh and light coming out of the packaging, and holds its shape well when cooked. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shorter and flimsier than its rival Rana (below), becoming soggy and brittle under the weight of the sauce. When considering that higher price tag ($3 per serve), I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to pass. Coles fresh fettuccine. Coles fettuccine, $4.20 for 300g\nServes two, ready in three minutes\nAdvertisement\nColes fettuccine keeps things simple, using just three Australian ingredients in its recipe. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flat, thin, pale and short \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certainly not one for those who like twirling their pasta. But in three minutes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooked perfectly al dente and gets the job done for just $2.10 per serve. Rana fettuccine, $6 for 325g\nServes two, ready in two minutes Rana delivers a light fettuccine that feels pretty close to restaurant-quality, maybe because of its egg content, which is higher than some. But does it \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake any sauce sing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as promised on the packaging? Well, it does capture the sauce. But it also becomes flimsy under the extra weight, breaking apart when twirled with a fork. It is also the most exxy of the bunch, at $3 per serve. iPastai fresh linguine.\nAdvertisement\nWINNER iPastai linguine, $5 for 350g\nServes three, ready in two minutes This pasta is made with flour, eggs and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpassion\u00e2\u0080\u009d, promising to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake you to the heart of Italy from the first bite\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I was sceptical, particularly given ambiguous descriptors like \u00e2\u0080\u009cItalian best flour\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the packaging, but I was proven wrong. The pasta felt light but substantial, firm to the bite and just a little sticky. It picked up all the sauce, passed the twirl test, and one bite quickly turned into an entire bowl.

New flu vaccines, snake anti-venoms, even ventolin for asthma sufferers can all contain animal products and cause life-threatening reactions for MMA sufferers.\n\"The mammalian allergen is in a number of medical products; for example, there's an anti-cancer drug which is a magic bullet for people with colon cancer and head and neck cancer, but unfortunately injected intravenously,\" Professor van Nunen said.\n\"This can be a life-threatening experience having this treatment.\"\nLocal GP expects more cases\nTrevor Cheney has worked as a GP for 22 years in Bellingen, a small town in a green valley not far from the NSW mid-north coast.\nAlthough he had no hard numbers, Dr Cheney said there had \"certainly\" been an increase in presentations of people with MMA.\nTrevor Cheney says some people might have had MMA for years and not known it.

( Supplied: Stephen Axford )\n\"The Australian paralysis tick needs animals but it also needs fairly humid areas to survive,\" Mr Doggett said.\n\"So areas like the Bellingen Valley, which is quite green and moist, tends to be highly conducive to this particular species.\"\nOther known hotspots are Sydney's densely populated northern beaches, and other valleys in NSW like the Tweed Valley.\n\"We've seen three La Ni\u00f1a seasons and that's associated with above-average rainfall conditions,\" Mr Doggett said.\n\"Ticks just love these conditions. When we get a lot of wet weather, this is often where we see the biggest numbers.\"\nMr Doggett said an El Ni\u00f1o cycle, which usually brings drier periods, could help curtail the number of ticks, but because there had been large numbers of the parasites in the previous season, there could be huge amounts of tick larvae now.\nStephen Doggett says there's been a huge rise in paralysis tick numbers. ( Supplied: NSW Health Pathology )\nProfessor van Nunen said not every tick would carry the allergen that can cause someone to develop MMA and not every tick bite would lead to the condition.\nBut she said there was a link between the rise in successful fox-baiting programs and the number of MMA cases.\nShe said the ticks started biting native mammals instead of foxes, and needed to make a sugar called alpha gal to adapt to their new food source.\nIt is that alpha gal which is then transferred to a human when a tick bites and can then cause a person to develop MMA.\n\"The number of people with mammalian meat allergy has exponentially risen, since fox baiting started,\" Professor van Nunen said.\nWhat to do if you're bitten by a tick\nHow someone responds to a tick bite can also determine whether they're likely to contract MMA.\n\"Don't scratch anything you can't see, don't disturb the tick because you'll squirt allergen into you,\" Professor van Nunen said.\n\"Kill the tick where it is and let it drop off because most people are hopeless at removing ticks.\n\"Or take yourself off to a health professional who has very fine forceps and can do it in an expert fashion.\"", "Matches": "3", "Num matches": 1.0}, {"publication": "SBS", "scraped_datetime": "07AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "Diaspora 'over the moon' as world congratulates India on successful lunar mission", "Url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/language/hindi/en/podcast-episode/diaspora-over-the-moon-as-indias-lunar-mission-succeed/o9fbbh97p", "Rank": 10, "Text": "In July, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) initiated the launch of a spacecraft with the objective of achieving a landing in the vicinity of the moon's south pole.\nOn Wednesday, the Indian spacecraft successfully landed on the moon at 6:04pm (Indian local time) and this has positioned India as the fourth nation to touch the lunar surface, following the US, Russia and China.\nThis image from video provided by the Indian Space Research Organisation shows the surface of the moon as the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft prepares for landing on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023.

I\u2019d come because all the community would come,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was a different era then.

There\u2019s a crew of 14 here and there\u2019s a sense of cultural obligation that keeps them coming back.\n\u201cI help my grandfather run the shed and I\u2019ve stepped into that role.\n\"So it\u2019s not that I want to [keep returning] ,it\u2019s that I have to,\u201d Steele Mansell said, sitting out in the rookery, with about 20 mutton birds he\u2019s caught lying at his feet.\nMutton birder numbers are dwindling, with a crew of only 14 on Babel this year.

( Supplied. )\nAnd yet, for the better part of a century, the mythology of Australian football has remained hidden at the end of a quiet road, at the back of a quiet pub: pushed to the side by an Anglo-Australian culture that has, until recently, been suspicious or outright hostile towards whatever didn't look, sound or feel like them.\nWarren spent much of his 61 years of life fighting to have football recognised across the country, not only by governments, businesses and media, but also by the wider public.\nHe and former SBS broadcaster Les Murray, a Hungarian-born migrant who moved to Australia in 1957 and immediately found identity and community through football, became known as \"Mr and Mrs Soccer\" for their constant advocacy on behalf of the game on programs like The World Game and On The Ball, which brought the international game into Australian homes.\nWarren's 2002 book titled \"Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters\" was one of the first to lay out the deep cultural connections between football and the changing face of Australia after World War II, with the title referring to the common insults those who played the game would receive throughout the mid-20th century.\nThere have been moments in which the game has threatened to crack through the ceiling of mainstream consciousness: the height of the old National Soccer League, the Socceroos' defeat of Uruguay to break their World Cup curse in 2005, the peak years of the A-League Men.\nBut football has never really stuck, often pulled backwards by its own cultural self-cannibalism and messy political in-fighting, while also struggling to stay relevant to those who, for one reason or another, believe that our national sport looks and sounds and feels like something else.\nThe Socceroos' defeat of Uruguay to qualify for their first World Cup in 32 years was a moment of national celebration. ( AAP Image: Mick Tsikas )\nAnd so football has turned inward, trying desperately to keep itself alive; lashing out at all those who would threaten it like a starving, frightened animal backed into a corner.\nThe women's game has been even more hidden, boxed away in cupboards and offices and garages across the country; so many of its stories surviving only in the memories of the women who were there to see for themselves.\nBut despite all of that, Warren's faith in the power of the game never wavered. He knew what this sport was capable of, so long as everybody within it saw the same picture.\nBefore his death from lung cancer in 2004, he was asked what he wanted his legacy to be.\n\"I told you so,\" was his now-famous answer.\n\"We've campaigned for so long, we've beaten against doors of trying to have the game accepted.\n\"We're this great sporting nation who has yet to embrace fully the world's greatest game.\"\nAs the sun sets on the 2023 Women's World Cup, what would Warren have said as he watched his beloved sport finally capture the hearts and minds of a nation that he always believed it would?\nThe numbers are one thing: almost 2 million tickets sold; record viewership on television and online streaming; newspapers and TV bulletins splashed with the faces and stories of the Matildas; green-and-gold jerseys swept off the racks by fans old and new.\nBut the feeling is another thing altogether. There is a feeling that something fundamental has shifted within the sport and as a country, where football has become the thing Warren and so many others always hoped it could be.\nWhat would Warren have thought that the seismic shift was triggered not just by football, but women's football: a segment of the game that has been even more neglected and overshadowed due to intersecting attitudes of sexism and homophobia, and has had to overcome so many more obstacles over the past century to finally get its moment in the sun?\nWhat would he have said knowing that Australia's captain is a queer woman of colour, whose goal against England in the team's first ever semifinal will be seared into the memories of generations of fans? A woman who has always used her voice to echo the spirit he was known for: believing deep in her bones that this sport is not just a sport, but a platform for change, for opportunity, for inclusion, for community.\nHow would he have felt knowing his spirit accompanied the Matildas throughout the World Cup? It was written in big bold letters across a banner carried by the team's active support group at each of their games, floating alongside a phrase the Matildas themselves adopted but that equally applies to the sport they are now front-and-centre of: \"never say die\".\nEach of the 23 players who represented Australia in this momentous month has represented the soul of football in their own unique way, from advocating for our domestic women's league to battling imposter syndrome to emerging from the wilderness of doubt and defeat to stand tall and take up space and become heroes in their own right.\nThis is a team, led by a head coach in Tony Gustavsson, who believed in themselves all the way to the end. Even when hope was at its lowest ebb, they turned inward in order to survive, knowing that their suffering was all part of a bigger purpose that no-one else could see.\nMatildas fans have carried Australian football's two most iconic sayings on banners to every game. ( Supplied. )\nThis is a group of women who know the power of being inspired, and carry that responsibility with them wherever they go. They know that they are only here for a short while \u2014 \"renting the jersey,\" as they say, and not owning it \u2014 and recognise their role in connecting the past with the future.\nAnd they know, now, that this World Cup is no longer about them.\nThey have done their part, giving everything of themselves to us and to each other, understanding that every goal and every pass and every tackle and every save will echo in the memory of someone out there who will point back one day and talk about how this was where their footballing dreams began.\n\"The only thing that's keeping me smiling right now is the way that we've inspired the nation,\" Sam Kerr said after their semifinal loss to England.\n\"I think the crowds and the fans have proved it, not us. They're the ones that have come out and supported us and watched us on the big screen and bought our jerseys.\n\"That's all down to the fans showing that this country really will get behind football if you bring the world game here.\n\"Hopefully this tournament changes that, because that's the legacy you leave: not what you do on the pitch, the legacy is what you do off the pitch.\n\"Hopefully this is the start of something new.\"\nKerr is right: it is not just this team that makes Australia a football nation. It's all of us.\nEvery time we pull on our boots and take a ball down to the local park, every time we flick on the television or click on a story, every time we buy a match ticket or wear a raggedy old jersey, every time we celebrate with a stranger or console with a friend.\nThe past month has been a living echo of Johnny Warren's words, belief and aspiration made deeply and achingly real, the idea of who we could be finally coming true.\nThe Matildas have helped us see something we have always believed about ourselves. ( AAP Image: Jono Searle )\nAustralian football's biggest battle has always been for relevance: of trying to show the rest of the country not just how this game looks, but how this game feels.\nThe Matildas' run has encapsulated it all, from the nervous beginning against Republic of Ireland to the hopeless loss to Nigeria, the heart-thumping come-back against Canada to the purposeful dismantling of Denmark, the game of destiny against France to the games of disappointment against England and Sweden.\nThey have allowed us to experience the edges and ebbs of hope and heartbreak, to hold every thrilling moment in our hearts and in our throats, to feel our minds racing and our chests pumping and our lungs burning as though we are down on that field with them, passing and tackling and sprinting through the night.\nThey have allowed us to feel the ecstasy of this beautiful game, its joys and its sorrows, its doors opening and closing, its ability to pull us all out of ourselves and make us part of some bigger thing: this communion of old and new worshippers, brought together in cathedrals of colour and sound, turning us into the true believers of what football can do and be and feel like. The dream made suddenly and miraculously real.\nThe road to Australian football's past may be easily missed, but the road to its future has never looked so clear and bright.\nThe Matildas may not have won the World Cup this time, as Warren always thought they could.

In a tweet promoting the movie, the film's distributors said, \"Break the Silence. Save The Children,\" a popular phrase coined by QAnon.\nThe first controversy: The QAnon support\nThe movie was shot in 2018, at a time when the American conspiracy theory movement, QAnon, was starting to gain traction.\nAnd its script was written in 2015, well before the movement's emergence in 2017, its writer and director Alejandro Monteverde told entertainment news publication Variety.\nWhile the film, made by Angel Studios, tells a non-partisan story and doesn't reference QAnon, believers of the conspiracy theory have latched onto the film, promoting it for their own agenda.\nQAnon followers believe that left-leaning elites in government, Hollywood stars and billionaires run a paedophile and human trafficking ring. They also believe that these people are harvesting an adrenaline-like substance from children to attain eternal life. Former US President Donald Trump is also thought by followers to be waging a secret battle against this \u201cdeep state\u201d scheme.\nIt hasn't helped that lead actor Caviezel has repeated several QAnon phrases on conservative talk shows like \"andrenochroming,\" the false term used to describe the extraction of a substance from child victims to harvest the elixir of youth. He has also used other language of the movement (\"a big storm is coming\") and in 2021, attended a QAnon-adjacent conference.\nAside from QAnon believers, the movie is being championed by other notable conservative figures like Trump, who hosted a viewing party at his golf course with Caviezel and the agent who inspired his role in attendance.\nMonteverde, who did not attend, said the political ties from others were hurting his film, and he prefers to keep his distance.\nThe second controversy: Misleading portrayals of child trafficking\nIn Sound of Freedom, Caviezel as Ballard takes on a crime syndicate in Colombia after children are snatched by strangers.\nThis depiction has stoked concern from human and child trafficking experts who say while people can be kidnapped by strangers and trafficked, it's not the typical way it's done.\nREAD MORE My daughter was taken by a sex trafficker and now has a price tag on her\nTypically, it's done by someone who knows the person and exploits that trust.

Credit: Angel Studios Angel Studios is a self-described values-based company, though others call it faith-based, as it is behind a number of Christian movies and shows. Before distributing original content, Angel Studios made its brand by removing nudity, swearing and violence from mainstream movies and shows before it was sued by a number of well-known Hollywood studios for copyright.\nTo raise the $5m ($7.8m) the company needed to distribute and market the film, it crowdfunded the money from \"angel\" investors.\nOne of the film's many investors, Fabian Marta, was arrested on 23 July and charged as an accessory for child kidnapping in the US state of Missouri, NewsWeek reported. While the details of the case are not public, this charge carries a penalty of 10 to 30 years in prison or life imprisonment.\nThe fourth controversy: The Pay-It-Forward sales are misleading\nIt's true the film has been unexpectedly popular, grossing more than the latest Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones movies in the US.\nBut some of these sales are being called into question.\nIn the film's closing credits, the hero of the film, Caviezel, asks viewers to \u201c pay it forward \u201d by buying someone else a ticket. It's unclear how many of those tickets actually translated into actual views, but people online have noticed that the theatres have sometimes been more vacant than online seat availability suggests.\nOn the Angel Studios site, under the heading, \"How can I join the fight to end child trafficking?\" the creators say, \"Seeing the film is the first step in spreading awareness about child trafficking,\" before suggesting to pay it forward or claim a free ticket.\nPaying it forward will help you \"join a historical movement to promote stories that amplify light,\" it writes.\nIn the

a picture of Australia in 40 years.\nAustralia's population will be much older and more heavily dependent on aged care.\nThe IGR has also laid bare the impact climate change could have on future generations.\nAustralians have been given the clearest snapshot of what their country will look like four decades from now.\nThe sixth Intergenerational Report (IGR), released two years after the last one, warns of how an ageing population and sliding birth rate will hit the economy in 2063.\nIt also gives insight into climate change's devastating impact on the economy, why your taxes may need to change, and how our increasingly volatile region could alter the way we trade.\n\"These forces will influence the future path and structure of our economy and change how Australians live, work, and engage with the world,\" it says.\nHere are the key takeaways.\nClimate change to rock the economy\nThe impact of climate change is a key feature of this year's IGR, and it's grim reading.\n\"Floods, bushfires and other extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity, causing major disruptions to local economic activity and ultimately hindering overall economic output,\" it says.\nThe report outlines four key areas that will be particularly impacted by 2063 if temperatures rise above two degrees:\nProductivity\nAgriculture\nTourism\nNatural disaster spending\nThe impact of higher temperatures could wipe away between $135 billion and $423 billion in productivity over the next four decades, it says.\nHigher temperatures will force international tourists to adjust where they travel, and the report predicts the impact will be twice as bad if temperatures rise by three degrees instead of two.\nThe government could be spending three times as much responding to natural disasters, the report says. Source: AAP / Sean Davey And it warns that increasingly frequent bushfires, floods and cyclones will also force tourists to cancel, or simply not book, trips to Australia. It also expects the government will need to spend triple what it does now responding to natural disasters.\nFarmers are also set for punishment. The IGR expects crop yields to fall by up to 4 per cent, and that's before changes to rainfall patterns are taken into account.\nWorse still, the report warns climate change's \"indirect and cumulative\" consequences are likely to exacerbate these challenges.\nGlobal efforts to move away from fossil fuels will upend Australia's resources sector.\nIf temperature rises are capped at 1.5 per cent, the IGR expects international demand for Australian coal in 2063 to be just 1 per cent of current levels. But it tips other critical minerals to become increasingly profitable, with global demand for lithium to increase eight-fold.\nA bigger, older population\nAustralia is going to get much bigger, and much older.\nThat will mean big economic challenges.\nThere'll be an extra 14 million people in the country by 2063, with the population to grow past 40 million. But it's worth noting previous IGRs have underestimated population growth.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers speaks to the media during a press conference. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi This year's prediction is partially based on a rise in life expectancy - from 81 to 87 for men, and from 85 to 89 for women - resulting from better health treatment.\nThat will pose challenges for older Australians, and potentially impact their standard of living.\n\"Longevity risk - the risk of outliving savings \u2013 is a key concern for retirees in deciding how to draw down their superannuation,\" the report says.\nAnd younger Australians are having fewer children, which will also skew age demographics.\nThe number of people over 65 is going to more than double by 2063, and the number of people over 85 is going to more than triple.\nThat means the economy will need to change drastically.\nWe'll become much more reliant on a rapidly expanded care sector, which includes things such as health and aged care. While the sector currently accounts for around 8 per cent of GDP, the report predicts it'll be around 15 per cent by 2063.\n\"Part of this demand may be met by data and digital technologies increasing productivity and enabling more Australians to participate in work,\" the report says.\nAustralia's older population will make it increasingly reliant on aged care. Source: Getty / Maskot\nEconomy to slow, some costs to blow out\nLike other countries in the OECD (a group of 38 countries with advanced economies), economic growth is also expected to slow, largely as a result of the above.\nAnd spending in certain key areas - aged care, the NDIS, health, defence, and interest on the nation's debt - is set to balloon.\nThose five currently account for around a third of government spending, but that's set to rise to roughly half.\nWorkers carrying more of tax burden\nRegular workers are set to pick up a greater chunk of the tax burden over the next decade.\nThat's because the budget will come to more heavily rely on personal income tax, with GST and company tax set to remain stable.\nA proportionately smaller pool of working-age Australians, supporting a higher proportion of retirees needing health and aged care, will put extra pressure on the budget.\nThere'll also be a longer-term shift in where government can source its money.\nLabor has long encouraged Australians to buy electric vehicles, and the shift away from regular cars is expected to accelerate this decade partly due to tax incentives. But fewer petrol cars means the government recouping less from taxes on petrol.\nThere's also been a consistent decline in the number of young Australians taking up smoking. If that trend continues, that again means less revenue from taxing cigarettes. That was worth about $14 billion in 2020-21.\nGeopolitical risks to increase\nIncreasing tensions in our region will pose challenges for decades.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare weaknesses in the global supply chains, the IGR also notes that trade and investment have increasingly been used as \"tools of statecraft\".\nAustralia has certainly borne the brunt of that, after a series of trade sanctions imposed on its exports by China.\nThe report says that dynamic is likely to deepen, something that will require \"unprecedented\" coordination between Australia's domestic policy, foreign policy, and national security arms.\nAnd a hot war in the Indo-Pacific would have \"far-reaching consequences\" for our economy, it warns.", "Matches": "16", "Num matches": 1.0}, {"publication": "The Guardian", "scraped_datetime": "07AM 25/08/23", "Headline": "List: all 14 last-minute amendments rushed through by the Queensland government without scrutiny", "Url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/24/list-all-14-last-minute-amendments-rushed-through-by-the-queensland-government-without-scrutiny", "Rank": 9, "Text": "Originally introduced in October last year, Queensland\u2019s child protection (offender reporting and offender prohibition order) and other legislation amendment bill started life as an extremely routine housekeeping law.\nThe bill updated a range of rules for people convicted of sexual offences, and modernised the child protection registry scheme, among other changes. Probably its most interesting element was to allow police to enter the home of more convicted offenders without a warrant to inspect their electronic devices, retrospectively.\nIt was expected to pass with little opposition, after sailing through a parliamentary committee process in February. It then sat on the notice paper for months.\nThat all changed at 3.29pm on Wednesday when minister for police Mark Ryan stood up in parliament to announce 57 pages of amendments to the bill \u2013 with minutes\u2019 notice.\nNow the bill would change everything from the operation of a north Queensland mining lease to the policing of sex workers, as well as requiring the suspension of the state\u2019s Human Rights Act, to allow for children to be kept indefinitely in adult watch houses.\nBut by introducing the changes so late in the process, the government ensured they wouldn\u2019t be scrutinised by parliamentary committees as most bills are.\nHere\u2019s a list of the 14 amendments attached to the bill and passed by Queensland\u2019s parliament on Thursday.\nThe first amendment removed the requirement for offenders on the sex crimes registry to report the location of every digital device they own or have access.\nThe government acted on longstanding inquiry recommendations, decriminalising the offences of begging and public drunkenness. The offences have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Queenslanders and homeless people, and are perceived as criminalising people for simply being poor. Minister Ryan said \u201cthese behaviours require a health and social welfare-based response\u201d rather than a criminal one.\nIn a related amendment, the laws limit the ability of police to punish people for public urination. Police will retain the power to issue an infringement notice to a person for public urination, in order to protect business in the CBD and the nightclub district of Fortitude Valley, according to Ryan\u2019s speech.\nThe government also moved to overturn a decision by the Queensland court of appeal which prevented it from imposing disciplinary sanctions on a number of police officers.

The former president\u2019s arrival in Georgia follows a presidential debate featuring his main rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination, a race in which Trump remains the overwhelmingly dominant frontrunner despite his many legal troubles. Trump had his legal team negotiate his booking to take place during the primetime viewing hours for the cable news networks, as he sought to discredit the charges and distract from the indignity of the surrender by turning it into a spectacle. But Trump was expected to be booked by authorities without the special privileges afforded to him in his other criminal cases, being subject to a mugshot that he had desperately sought to avoid, having his fingerprints taken, as well as having his height and weight recorded.

We\u2019re covering all this as it happens, so do stick with Guardian US.

Two days ago he asked a federal court in an emergency motion to block his arrest, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. He asked the court to \u201cprotect\u201d him from arrest before a Monday 28 August, hearing on his request to move the case out of the Fulton county superior court to the district court of northern Georgia. Meadows is arguing that the charges against him concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. Trump is expected to argue likewise in due course. In response, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis unequivocally rejected the request, noting: \u201cI am not granting any extensions\u201d and that he was no different from any other defendant in a criminal case. Willis indicated that if Meadows does not turn himself in by noon on Friday, he would be arrested, writing: \u201cAt 12:30 pm on Friday I shall file warrants in the system.\u201d Early Thursday afternoon, he surrendered to the jail to be booked.

( ImagineChina via AFP: Feng Lei Sh )\nHer father transferred 70 per cent of company shares to then 26-year-old Ms Yang before the company went public on the Hong Kong Stock exchange in 2007, with an initial public offering (IPO) of $US1.7 billion.\nThat rocketed her to almost the top of the rich list.\nFather and daughter jointly managed operations from 2018, before the 42-year-old fully took over the company as chairperson earlier this year.\n\"She was worth $US34 billion a few years ago and very much stood out as being a rich woman in China, a country where it's generally businessmen who get all the headlines,\" said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst who specialises in the Chinese economy.\nHer appointment may have broken ground for businesswomen in China, but it came at a precarious time in the country's real estate market.\nCountry Garden reported a 90 per cent drop in core profit for 2022, and recently advised of a net loss ranging from approximately $US9,7 billion to $US11,7 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2023.\nIn one of her first acts in the new role, Ms Yang announced the company would focus on core geographical areas, reducing its presence in smaller cities.\nBut after missing interest repayments and with a bill looming, it's unclear whether the action may have been too late.\nChina's real estate crackdown\nCountry Garden is far from the first developer in China to come under strain.\nIn 2020, the country's communist government began a massive crackdown on risky behaviour in its property market, which operated with enormous levels of debt.\nInvestors soured on Country Garden this month after it revealed it was struggling to pay its debts. ( Reuters: Tingshu Wang )\nWith less easy money available, the sector \u2014 which accounts for more than a quarter of China's GDP, according to some estimates \u2014 has struggled to pay its bills.\nLast year, hundreds of mostly small developers filed for bankruptcy, according to a note by Andrew Collier from Orient Capital Research.\nAdditionally, after years of incredible demand for housing, the market is cooling and millions of apartments are sitting empty.\nAs the crisis worsened, property giant Evergrande began to show signs of distress, missing bond payments and triggering speculation its downfall could have flow on effects as the world grappled with the economic consequences of the pandemic.\nAfter nearly two years in limbo, it filed for bankruptcy protection last week in the US, not long after Country Garden revealed it owes $US200 billion.\nUnlike Evergrande, Country Garden's woes largely came as a surprise.\n\"It had always been seen as less risky property developer,\" said Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.\n\"The belief was that for Country Garden, because the distribution of [its] land bank tended to be in favourable places, their sales would not suffer, and they should be able to repay their debt.\n\"But I think one of the underlying dynamics that's very interesting here is that unlike in previous downturns in the real estate market \u2026 we are seeing prices drop even in Shanghai, and Shanghai property prices have basically been on an upward trajectory without any interruption.\"\nIf Country Garden misses the deadline for the end of its grace period, the company and its shareholders risk being sued by its creditors.\nBut even if they do find the money, its problems are far from over says Mr Howie.\n\"It will only be a matter of time because the underlying problem remains, [that being] the property market is broken,\" he said.\nOne of Asia's richest woman has her fortune cut in half\nLess than two years ago, Ms Yang was worth an estimated $US30 billion, making her Asia's richest woman by a long shot, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.\nBut her fortune has been cut by more than half in a matter of months, after Country Garden sought to raise cash by selling discounted shares last year, as China was gripped by a mortgage boycott.\nAt some sites construction has slowed or completely stopped, with workers telling Reuters they haven't been paid since January \u2013 although a statement from the company disputed this.\nIt's estimated Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to finish, but it said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange it would \"spare no effort\" to fulfil its orders.\n\"The Company will effectively ensure the operation of projects nationwide and complete the tasks of property delivery by implementing its main responsibilities, utilising funds according to their specific purposes and strictly controlling pre-sale monitoring funds etc., so as to fulfil its commitment to property owners,\" the statement read.\nCountry Garden is now the equivalent of a Hong Kong penny stock, with the share price having plunged more than 70 per cent this year.\nIts woes could be a sign that the heiress has lost some of her political clout, expert suggest.\n\"I think she once was very, very connected, could call up very senior officials and get different things done but I suspect that may not be the case so much anymore,\" Professor Shih said.\n\"Because if Country Garden still had that kind of political clout, none of this would have been necessary in the first place.\n\"The one thing about an overseas bankruptcy or distress situation, is that everyone knows it would immediately be covered by global media, and the whole world would know it, and also that information will go back to the top leadership through different channels \u2026 so it really is a sure way to get the leadership's attention.\"\nChina's property sector accounts for more than a quarter of China's GDP, according to some estimates. ( Reuters: Tingshu Wang )\nAnd while Ms Yang's fortune is declining, it's also under increasing scrutiny.\nEarlier this month, the company announced Ms Yang had donated more than half her stake in the company \u2014 worth more than $US800 million \u2014 to a family charity.\nThe practice has become more common among China's super wealthy as a result of a Chinese Communist Party policy called \"Common Prosperity\".\nWhile it is not clearly defined, the policy is generally understood to involve reducing the gap between China's elite and its poorest citizens.\n\"There's no tax distribution, there was actually no economic policies whatsoever to support Common Prosperity,\" explained Mr Collier.\n\"However, the ability to use that to grab money from the large capitalist firms is the key to it.\"\nSome of China's major companies \u2014 including Ali Baba and a lot of big tech firms \u2014 have set up charities in recent years, he said.\n\"One gets a sense that basically the regime, including the provincial governors, are so desperate for money that they'll just go to whoever has it \u2026 [and] the government may simply say, 'Well, you know, we want that money' and they'll just take it,\" he said.\n'Building more houses doesn't solve your problems'\nAfter strict COVID controls were lifted at the end of last year, there were hopes that China's economy would jump back to life and in turn provide a shot in the arm for the global economy.\nBut they have been well and truly dashed in recent months, with property far from the country's only economic problem.\nFor years, developers have put up large apartment blocks in isolated parts of China. ( Reuters: Lusha Zhang )\nSome huge trusts operating as shadow banks have missed repayments and one in five young people are unemployed, a situation which has become so bad that the Chinese government has stopped publishing data on youth unemployment.\nOfficially the Chinese Government said it needed to review its methodology for the measure.\nOn the back of the latest Evergrande and Country Garden news, stocks in Hong Kong \u2014 made up largely of mainland Chinese companies \u2014 last week plunged more than 20 per cent below the most recent peak.\nTypically Chinese homebuyers purchase a property before it's completed, meaning some are now servicing mortgages for homes with an uncertain future.\nWith many cash-strapped Chinese developers now on shaky footing, there are fears this may have knock-on effects on ongoing builds of pre-sold housing projects, exacerbating an already diminishing confidence among the wider public.\nWhile this is yet to play out, the Chinese cultural belief that money would be safe in houses is being put to the test, according to Mr Howie.\n\"Where we now find ourselves after 20 plus years of this [economic growth is] there simply is a huge oversupply of property, particularly in the lower tier cities, where building has well outstripped demand,\" he said.\n\"[Now] you've got people who don't necessarily have enough money to spend or are wanting to save their money, a job market that is much tighter, you simply don't have the demand you had before,\" he said.\n\"And so the previous model of selling properties to new buyers, and that will fund the future development is starting to fall apart.\"\nThere have been various predictions of a stimulus announcement by the CCP, but so far any responses have been conservative.\n\"I think the capacity for China to have a big stimulus is much more limited than it was in the past,\" says Mr Howie.\n\"You also have the problem that stimulus no longer works in the way it once did, if you've got too many roads, bridges and houses, building more of them doesn't solve any of your problems.\"", "Matches": "1", "Num matches": 1.0}]
